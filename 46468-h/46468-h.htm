<p>Archibald Campbell, the author of a “Voyage round the

the fact of his having been a seaman on board said ship,
I readily do it.</p>

<p>His Book contains many interesting facts, and is worthy
the perusal of persons who take pleasure in looking into
works of this kind. His misfortunes, and the constant
good deportment he has shewn since his return from the
Sandwich Islands, give him a strong claim on the community.</p>

<h2>PREFACE. </h2>


<p>A perusal of the voyages of discovery, which shed so
much lustre on the reign of George III. naturally excites a
strong desire to learn what effects have been produced
among the nations whose existence they have introduced
to our notice.</p>

<p>That the interests of science and commerce have been
greatly promoted by these voyages, cannot be doubted;
but it may be questioned whether the result has been equally
beneficial to the natives of the newly discovered countries;
and, as the editor<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of Cook’s last voyage justly remarks,
“it would afford exquisite pleasure to every benevolent
mind, to be instructed in facts which might enable
us without hesitation to answer in the affirmative.”</p>

<p>The solution of this momentous question can only be obtained
from the accounts of subsequent visitors; and the
following narrative is submitted to the public, as a contribution
to the evidence required for that purpose. It was
drawn up partly from the papers,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but chiefly from the
recital of the author; and the editor has adhered as closely
as the nature of the case would permit, to the language in
which they were originally related. The intervention of
a third person between the traveller and the reader, is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
evil which ought always, if possible, to be avoided; but
in the present instance, some literary assistance was absolutely
necessary; and the editor conceives he shall best
have executed the task he has imposed upon himself, by
stating, with strict fidelity, and in the simplest language,
the facts as they were related to him.</p>

<p>A short account of the life of the narrator will enable
the reader to judge of the necessity of such assistance, as
well as of his qualifications to relate the incidents of his
voyage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Archibald Campbell</span> was born at Wynford, near Glasgow,
on the 19th of July, 1787. His father, who was a
soldier in the 45th regiment, died at St. Lucia, upon which
his mother removed to Paisley, her native place, when her
son was about four years of age. He there received the
common rudiments of education, and at the age of ten was
bound apprentice to a weaver. Before the term of his apprenticeship
had expired, however, a strong desire to visit
remote countries induced him to go to sea; and in the year
1800, he entered as apprentice on board the ship Isabella,
of Port-Glasgow, commanded by Mr. Hugh Paterson. In
this vessel he made three voyages to the West-Indies. He
afterwards served about a twelvemonth in a coaster; and,
in 1804, again sailed for the West-Indies, in the sloop Robina,
belonging to the same port.</p>

<p>At Madeira he was pressed on board the Diana frigate,
and remained in that ship till her arrival at Portsmouth in
1806. He there found means to make his escape, and entered
as seaman on board the Thames Indiaman.</p>

<p>The history of the six most eventful years of his life
will be found in the following pages. He returned to his
native country, in April, 1812, having lost both his feet;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and from the unskilful manner in which amputation has
been performed, the wounds have never healed.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Rio Janeiro, of the name of Lawrie,
had furnished him with letters to his father in Edinburgh,
by whose interest he obtained admission into the Infirmary
in that city; but after remaining there nearly four months,
he was dismissed as incurable.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrie, senior, presented him with a barrel organ;
and he contrived to earn a miserable pittance, by crawling
about the streets of Edinburgh and Leith, grinding music,
and selling a metrical history of his adventures.</p>

<p>Being ambitious, however, of performing on a more dignified
instrument, he has since learned to play on the violin;
and he finds employment on board the steam-boats
that ply upon the river Clyde, by playing for the amusement
of the steerage passengers.</p>

<p>In one of these vessels his appearance attracted the notice
of the editor; and the answers he gave to some questions
excited so much curiosity, that he took him home
with the intention of making a few memoranda of his story
for his own information.</p>

<p>The modest and intelligent manner in which it was told,
the interesting nature of the incidents, and the curious information
it contained, on the subjects to which the attention
of the editor had been much directed, created a strong
interest on behalf of the narrator; and the hope that an
account of his voyage might be of service to an unfortunate
and deserving man, and not unacceptable to those who
take pleasure in contemplating the progress of mankind in
the arts of civilization, gave rise to the present publication.</p>

<p>In the execution of his task, simplicity and perspicuity
are all that the editor has aimed at. The ornaments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
style, which are generally misplaced in such relations,
would have been peculiarly incongruous in the mouth of a
common sailor. In those parts of the work which relate
to places already well known, the narrative is entirely confined
to the personal adventures of the author; and had
the editor been aware that so much had been recently written
regarding Kamschatka and the Aleutian Islands by the
Russian navigators, the description of those places would
have been either altogether omitted, or much more condensed;
but, in fact, he had no opportunity of seeing
their voyages till the work was sent to the press, and it was
not then considered necessary to make any alteration in
the text.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject will account for the disproportion
of that part which relates to the Sandwich
Islands to the rest of the work. From the advantages they
owe to their situation, placed midway between the continents
of Asia and America; from the fertility of the soil,
and the natural talents and industry of the natives, they
promise to become by far the most important of the recently
discovered islands<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>Scarcely thirty years have elapsed from the period of
their discovery, yet how wonderful the change!<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
king is surrounded by workmen of every description, native
and European; his guards are regularly trained to the
use of fire arms; and he possesses a navy of nearly sixty
sail of decked vessels, built upon the islands; whilst almost
every ship which navigates the Pacific, finds shelter, provisions,
or trade, in his harbors.</p>

<p>In Tamaahmaah these islanders possess one of those
remarkable characters, who, like Alfred or Peter the Great,
seems destined to hasten the progress of civilization. He
is known in this country from the accounts of Turnbull,
Lisianski, and Langsdorf; but as none of these navigators
ever saw that chief, their accounts are consequently very
imperfect; the length of time, however, during which our
author remained in his family, afforded him opportunities
of observation not enjoyed by those of higher qualifications,
and in some measure compensates for the unavoidable
defects of his education.</p>

<p>Although no new discoveries, strictly speaking, are recorded,
the work will not be found altogether destitute of
useful nautical information; the account of the reef to the
southwest of Halibut Island, upon which the ship was
wrecked, and the numerous rocks that lie near the coast
of Aliaski, will show what ought to be avoided; and in
the account of the south coast of Wahoo, will be found a
description of the only harbours in the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>From the humble situation held by the author, a distrust
may be entertained of his qualifications to relate the facts
which fell under his notice; but few, in the same ranks of
life, are possessed of more intelligence or information;
with the advantages common to his countrymen, he seems
to have neglected no means of improvement. It will be
seen that at the age of nineteen he was appointed a petty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
officer, and had he not been incapacitated by his misfortune,
it may be presumed, that he would soon have attained
a higher rank.</p>

<p>The editor has to claim indulgence on his own account.
His motives for undertaking the work, and the principles
upon which it has been executed, have been already stated;
the work is published for the benefit of the poor fellow
who is the subject of it; nor would it ever have met the
public eye, had there been any chance that the task would
have been undertaken by another hand. But to rescue
much of what is true and extraordinary from the oblivion
to which the obscure condition and limited powers of the
narrator would have condemned it, appeared to him well
deserving of the labour which he had bestowed. The best
apology for the appearance of the work itself will be found
in the words of a celebrated periodical publication.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “It
is obvious that the discovery of new tribes, and the first
account of manners formerly unknown, are by no means
more interesting than the subsequent history of those tribes,
and the changes which rapidly take place in their manners.
The greatest obligations, therefore, are conferred upon us
by those adventurous persons who, having visited these
islands of late years, give such statements of what they
saw, as enable us to trace the progress of society in one
of its earliest stages, and to estimate the effects produced
by the sudden revolution in their circumstances which the
natives have experienced from their intercourse with Europeans.”</p>

<p>Early in May, 1806, I entered as seaman
on board the Thames Indiaman, Matthew
Riches, Esq. commander, on a voyage to
China.</p>

<p>We sailed on the 14th of that month from
Motherbank, in company with the Arniston,
Royal Charlotte, Glatton, Marquis of Ely,
Marquis of Wellesley, Monarch, Cirencester,
and Neptune, Indiamen, under convoy of the
Lion, 64, and Medusa frigate; we were also
accompanied by a fleet of transports, with
troops, destined for the expedition to Buenos
Ayres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In our voyage to the Cape of Good Hope,
no incident occurred worthy of being recorded,
not even the ordinary ceremonies upon
crossing the line. We had a detachment of the
30th regiment on board, the commanding officer
of which did not choose that the men should
undergo the ducking usual upon that occasion.
About this time I was appointed sail-maker’s
mate.</p>

<p>We arrived at the Cape on the 7th of August,
and remained there 15 days.</p>

<p>We sailed from thence on the 22d; and on
the day after our departure, encountered a severe
gale of wind. It came on so suddenly
that we had only time to take in our studding
sails; all the others, except the fore and fore-top
gallant sails, were blown out of the bolt
ropes; the ship was running before the wind,
and broached to several times; fortunately,
however, we suffered no other damage than
the loss of the sails. We experienced two
other gales whilst in the Indian seas, but, being
better prepared, met with no material accident.</p>

<p>On the 12th of September we saw the
island of St. Paul, and arrived at Pulo Penang,
or Prince of Wales’ Island, about the middle
of October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>We proceeded on our voyage for China on
the 24th of November, and anchored at Wampoa
on the 18th of January, 1807.</p>

<p>Having remained there nearly six weeks,
and taken in about half of our cargo, an unfortunate
dispute took place between the
crew of the Neptune and some Chinese, in
which one of the latter lost his life. In consequence
of this, the government insisted
that a man should be given up in his place,
and stopped the loading of the ships to enforce
compliance with this demand, threatening,
at the same time, to prevent their departure
by choking up the second bar.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> As
a measure of precaution the ships dropped
down the river below the bar, and a boat
was despatched to Canton to wait the orders
of the commodore.</p>

<p>I was sent in the cutter on this service;
and during the time of our stay in that city,
the captain of the American ship Arthur,
bound to Rhode-Island, endeavored to induce
me to quit the ship I belonged to, by
offering high wages, and a bounty of twenty
dollars; I, however, declined his proposals.
Afterwards, when I was in company with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
comrade of the name of Allen, we were met
by another American captain, who also tried
to persuade us, by offering still higher wages;
we resisted his offers, till he informed
us that his ship was bound for the South
Seas and the north west coast of America.&mdash;It
had always been my ambition to visit
those distant parts of the world, and the
opportunity that now presented itself was
too tempting to be resisted. We agreed to
his terms; and as his ship lay at Wampoa,
he concealed us in the American factory till
an opportunity of proceeding thither should
occur.</p>

<p>Whilst at this place, we very narrowly
escaped detection. Being in want of provisions,
we sent out a Chinese to buy some
bread, and gave him a dollar stampted with
Captain Riches’ initials. Instead of fulfilling
his commission, he took the dollar to
the captain, and brought him to the factory.
When we saw them approach, we made
our escape from a window to the top of an
adjoining house, and ran along the roofs,
till we reached a warehouse, which we
asked permission to pass through; this the
owner refusing, I went out on a beam that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
crossed the street, and dropped on the ground,
being a fall of about eighteen feet.&mdash;When
the Chinese observed this, he allowed my
comrade to pass through the house. I was a
good deal stunned with the fall, but soon recovered
myself. We then got to the river
side, where we hired a <i>san-pan</i>, or small boat,
to take us to Wampoa, and reached the ship
with no other interruption.</p>

<p>She was called the Eclipse, and belonged
to Boston; a new ship, on her first voyage,
commanded by Captain Joseph O’Kean. She
was chartered by the Russian American Company,
for their settlements at Kamschatka,
and the northwest coast of America, with a
cargo of nankeens, tea, silks, sugar, rice, and
other articles, the produce of China. The
number of the crew, including officers, amounted
to twenty-eight, four or five of which were
procured from the Indiamen. There was also
a Russian supercargo.</p>

<p>At Captain O’Cain’s desire I changed my
name, which I entered on the ship’s books as
Archibald Macbride.</p>

<p>Having completed our cargo, the ship sailed
on her voyage upon the eighth of May.&mdash;When
opposite to Macao, we saw the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fleet getting under way; the Captain,
fearing that the man-of-war might board us,
and take the men belonging to the India ships,
put back, and remained within the Bocca Tigris
till they were out of sight.</p>

<p>On the 6th of June we descried the coast
of Japan, and ran along shore till we reached
the bay of Nangasaki.</p>

<p>We stood into the bay under Russian colors,
and were met by an immense fleet of
boats, who took possession of the ship, and
towed her to the anchorage. When about
half way up the bay, the Dutch ambassador
came off. He could speak English; and
finding we were Americans, advised us to
haul down the colors, informing us that the
natives were much exasperated at some outrages
lately committed by the Russians upon
their islands. We found this to be so much
the case, that we deemded it prudent to keep
the supercargo out of sight during the whole
of our stay.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<p>When the ship was moored, eight guard-boats
were anchored round us, within pistol-shot,
and no person allowed to land or hold
any communication with the shore; the muskets
were taken out of the arm-chests, and our
gunpowder demanded; six or eight kegs were
given up, with the assurance that it was all we
had.</p>

<p>Seeing so many boats come off, a large assortment
of articles of trade was brought on
deck, but none of the people would make any
purchase. They told us they had plenty of
every thing we had to offer.</p>

<p>When the captain was asked what brought
him to Japan, he replied, want of water and
fresh provisions; and ordered several butts
in the hold to be started and hoisted on deck
empty. Next day a plentiful supply was sent
off, in small boats, filled with water, and in
tubs, which we were obliged to empty on
deck, stopping the scuppers, and allowing it
to run off at night. We were also abundantly
supplied with fresh fish, hogs, and vegetables;
the whole of which was furnished gratis.</p>

<p>On the third day of our stay, the Captain,
finding nothing was to be gained by remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>ing,
got under way. The arms and ammunition
were immediately restored, and the
ship was towed about five miles out of the
bay, by nearly a hundred boats; on parting
the crews cheered us, waving their hats and
hands.</p>

<p>The town of Nangasaki was concealed by
an island; but from the view we had of the
land, it seemed to be in a state of high cultivation,
and very populous. The natives have
the appearance and complexion of the Chinese,
but are taller in stature.</p>

<p>Their boats, which were open, with small
covered cabins abaft, were mounted with
guns, about the size of our largest swivels.
Instead of being rowed they were sculled;
the oars on each side never being lifted out
of the water. In each of them were two
men, apparently officers, dressed in loose
frocks or gowns, with long hanging sleeves.
These were armed with matchlocks, and had
a sabre hanging at each side.</p>

<p>After leaving Nangasaki, we navigated the
strait which separates the principal island
of Japan from others that lie to the north:
in several places it is not above five miles
broad. On each side the country is beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>ful,
abounding with cultivated fields, woods,
villages, and single houses. Frequently, when
near the coast, we observed the inhabitants
come down to the shore, and make signals, as
if to invite us to land; but, after the reception
we had already experienced, the captain did
not choose to have any further communication
with the Japanese.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>At one time, in a thick fog, we were alarmed
with the noise of breakers, apparently very
near. Upon sounding, we found twenty fathoms,
sandy bottom, and immediately let go
the anchor. When the haze cleared away, we
found ourselves close to a remarkable island
or rock, about the size and the height of the
craig of Ailsea, in the Frith of Clyde. An
archway passed completely through it; and
into this the sea rushed with that tremendous
noise which had occasioned our late alarm.</p>

<p>In about a week we were clear of the strait,
and proceeded on our voyage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>The 4th of July, being the anniversary of
American Independence, was celebrated by
a salute. One of the guns having missed fire,
the captain took the powder-horn to prime it;
in doing which some fire in the gun kindled
the powder, and exploded the horn. By this
accident his hand was dreadfully scorched and
lacerated.</p>

<p>Upon the 6th we descried the two lofty
mountains of St. Peter and St. Paul, in Kamschatka.</p>

<p>Owing to foggy weather, it was two days
before we discovered the entrance of Awatska
bay. We were within the heads on the
8th, and were met by a Russian boat, on
board of which was Mr. Meznikoff, commissioner
of the store, who piloted us into
the harbour of Petrapaulouska, or St. Peter
and St. Paul. The ship having been seen
off the coast, intelligence had been given of
our arrival by people stationed for the purpose
at a light-house on the north side of the
entrance.</p>

<p>Awatska bay is a spacious basin, 25 or 30
miles in circumference; any part of it would
afford safe anchorage, but it has three very
fine harbours. That of St. Peter and St. Paul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
where we lay, is sheltered from every wind
by a projecting woody point; but, owing to
the great height of the mountains is subject
to heavy squalls.</p>

<p>The entrance to the bay is not above a
mile and a half wide, and may be known by
several remarkable rocks on the starboard
hand going in, somewhat like the needles at
the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>We remained at St. Peter and St. Paul
thirty-three days, and discharged nearly one
third of our cargo.</p>

<p>The town, although the principal sea-port
of the Peninsula of Kamschatka, is nothing
more than a miserable village, containing
300 or 400 inhabitants, of whom about two-thirds
are Russians and the remainder natives.
It is situated on an eminence above
the harbour, and, with the exception of the
governor’s house, consists of huts of one story
high, built of logs and covered with thatch.
In a few of them the windows are glazed with
talc, but more generally the intestine of the
seal supplies the place of glass.</p>

<p>The huts of the natives lie below the
town towards the shore. They are almost
wholly under ground, nothing but the roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
being seen, which is long and rounded at the
top, resembling a vessel with the bottom upwards.</p>

<p>On a rising ground on the north side of the
harbour, near the governor’s house, stands an
obelisk, erected to the memory of Captain
Clerke, the coadjutor of Captain Cook, who
died at sea, and was buried at this place. The
monument is about sixteen or eighteen feet
high, built of hewn stone, with a ship on the
top; there were inscriptions on each side,
which were much defaced by the weather;
and owing to the rail which surrounded the
place, we could not get near enough to ascertain
in what language they were written.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The natives are stout made, round-faced,
with a yellowish complexion. The men are
dressed in skin frocks; the women in a similar
dress made of nankeen.</p>

<p>The country round is perfectly barren, and
no cultivation of any kind is to be seen, except
one or two gardens near the town.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<p>They have a few horses and horned cattle;
but these are so scarce, that the fresh beef we
required was brought from Boltcheresk, a distance
of seventy miles.</p>

<p>On the right hand entrance of the bay, and
round by the foot of the mountain, the country
is covered with wood, chiefly pines.</p>

<p>The town and its neighbourhood are infested
with an immense number of the dogs used
for sledges in winter. At this season, they are
allowed to go at large and find food for themselves.
They live almost entirely upon fish,
which they obtain either by springing upon
them as they lie in the water, or picking them
up dead along the shore. In winter, they are
fed upon dried fish, which are cured in large
open sheds erected for that purpose on the
shore, and which, it would appear, they prefer
to any other food. Our sailors, by way of
amusement, often purloined a few to give to
the dogs; in consequence of which kindness,
thousands of these hungry creatures watched
the landing of our boat, and flocked after us,
to the great annoyance of the inhabitants.&mdash;This
practice became at last so troublesome,
that the Russians insisted on our putting an
end to it. Their howling every morning at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
day-break, was so intolerable, as to awaken
us even on board the ship.</p>

<p>Boltcheresk, the capital of Kamschatka, is
about seventy miles from St. Peter and St.
Paul. The communication in the winter
season is by sledges drawn by dogs over the
snow; in summer the intercourse is carried on
by the river Awatska, which being in some
places extremely shallow, boats of a particular
construction are made use of. They are formed
of light frames of wood, covered with
tarpaulin, and are so flat in the bottom that
they do not draw above six inches water;
they are extremely light, and can easily be
carried over the rapids.</p>

<p>The two remarkable mountains, St. Peter
and St. Paul, which give name to the place,
lie about thirty miles to the north. One of
them is a volcano; and when we could see
the top, which was seldom free from clouds,
it was constantly smoking, and at night sparks
were frequently to be seen. An eruption took
place some time before our arrival, by which
the whole town was covered with ashes.</p>

<p>There were no vessels at this place during
our stay, except the wreck of a ship which
had sunk in the harbour; the sails having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
been loosed for the purpose of drying, a sudden
squall laid her on her beam-ends, when
she filled and went down.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> As the upper
works were above the surface at low water,
it appeared to us that she might have been
raised without much difficulty; but it seems
they did not mean to make the attempt, for
her cordage and anchors were put on board
our vessel.</p>

<p>Whilst we remained here we were abundantly
supplied with the finest salmon, and
fish of all descriptions.</p>

<p>Having delivered the part of our cargo
which was to be left at this place, we sailed
on the 8th of August for the settlements on
the Aleutian Islands.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHAPTER II. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Departure from Kamschatka&mdash;Shipwrecked on a reef of
rocks, on the northwest coast of America&mdash;Author, with
the rest of the crew, save themselves by the long boat&mdash;Are
drifted on an island&mdash;Transactions upon the island&mdash;Prepare
to build a vessel.</p></div>


<p>We left Kamschatka on the 8th of August,
and proceeded on our voyage to the northwest
coast of America. Nothing material
occurred till the 10th of September. On
the morning of that day it blew hard from
the south, and the ship was reduced to close
reefed topsails; about three in the afternoon,
the gale increased to such a degree that it
became necessary to take in the fore and
mizen topsails. Whilst the men were on the
yards, they discovered land off the lee bow,
distant about five or six leagues; we conjectured
it to be that part of the continent
called Aliaska; the ship’s course was immediately
altered from N. E. to E. and the weather
proving more moderate in the evening,
stood on, close hauled, but did not
set more sail. About ten at night, the alarm
was given that there were breakers ahead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and on the lee bow. Mr. Brinkman, the
chief mate, who had the charge of the watch,
immediately went to the mizen topmast head,
and observing there was room to wear the
ship, hastened below to report the circumstance
to the captain. When he returned
upon deck, he instantly went to the wheel
and ordered us to our stations, with the intention
of wearing; but the captain, who
followed him, was of a different opinion; he
said what we saw was only white water, and
not breakers; that there was no danger, and
ordered us to stand on our course. He had
scarcely given this order before the ship
plunged, and struck with such violence as
to knock away the fore-foot, and the watch
below were driven from their hammocks
against the deck. The sea running very
high, she beat so hard that in a few minutes
the rudder was unshipped, and the stern-post
forced up through the poop; as she
still had way upon her, she shot over the reef
into deep water: upon sounding we found seventeen
fathoms. It was immediately determined
to let go the anchor, and remain by the
ship as long as she would swim. In case she
went down, we hoped to save our lives by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
long-boat, which was accordingly cleared and
hoisted out, that she might be ready; seven of
the guns were at the same time thrown overboard,
in order to keep her above water until
daylight. The carpenter attempted to sound
the well, but owing to some obstacle, could not
get down the sounding rod. I was sent below
with him to bore a hole beside the pump thro’
the lower deck; but on taking off the after
hatch, we found the water as high as the shifting
boards.</p>

<hr class="tb hidden" />

<p>Early on the morning of the 11th, to our
great joy, we saw land to the leeward of us,
distant about three or four leagues. It was immediately
determined to watch the lull, slip the
cable, and cast the ship’s head in shore, and
steer her for it with the jib and fore-topsail.&mdash;After
she was under way, the captain ordered
that any of the crew that could not swim should
go into the long-boat astern, and be ready as
soon as she struck to come alongside for the
rest, as he expected that she would then go to
pieces. As soon as she struck, all hands came
into the boat, and went for the shore, the captain
taking his quadrant, until the tide should
ebb, when he expected she would be nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
dry. We landed between eleven and twelve
o’clock in the forenoon.</p>

<p>The land upon which we were thrown presented
a most dreary appearance; it was an
extensive plain, intersected by pools of fresh
water, stretching about five miles from the sea,
and terminated by two mountains. The
ground was covered with heath and moss; not
a tree nor a bush could be seen, neither did
we observe the least trace of human habitations.
As the land afforded us no sustenance,
we turned our attention to the sea, and when
the tide ebbed found some large muscles.&mdash;Having
satisfied our hunger with some raw
muscles, we prepared to go off to the ship; but
on our way off we had the mortification to see
her fall over on her beam ends. When we
reached the ship we found that we could do
nothing with her, and were preparing to leave
her, when we discovered in the bottom of the
long-boat the carpenter’s axe; we then cut the
parrel and gear of the main-topsail yard, and
let it drive clear of the wreck, while we went
to cut away the topmasts, and then left her for
that day. On our way ashore we found the
main-topsail yard, and took it in tow, and
landed again about six o’clock in the evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
The approach of night rendering some shelter
necessary, we made a sort of tent with a
sail, and lay down on the moss, cold and wet,
and spent a most uncomfortable night.</p>

<p>Next morning, the 12th, we set off along
shore in search of any thing that might have
driven from the ship, and found, in a bay at
no great distance from our tent, a barrel of
rosin, the arm chest, with one or two small
carbines, some swan-shot, and, what was of
greater consequence to us, several calking
irons and mallets; on finding these we went
to the ship, but the sea was so high we could
not come near her, and we returned to our
tent.</p>

<p>On the 13th, 14th, and 15th, we were employed
in repairing the boat, which had begun
to get very leaky; having picked some oakum,
we calked the seams as well as we could. Over
the places where this was insufficient, we nailed
pieces of boards, and calked round the edges.
Although we could not pay the seams, having
nothing to melt our rosin in, we succeeded in
making her tolerably tight.</p>

<p>On the 16th several pieces of wreck and some
sails were secured; this day was chiefly employed
in preparations for going off to the wreck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
We formed a grappling iron by lashing four
bolts together, and bending them, and made
a line out of the rigging that came ashore
with the spars; this proved of great service in
fishing up articles from the wreck. Every
thing being ready, and the 17th proving fine,
we set off at day-break, and taking the carpenter’s
axe with us, we cut a large hole in
her side, just before the main channels.&mdash;With
the grappling irons we hooked several
sails, and a number of other articles, such as
boxes of silks and nankeens, and made three
different trips to the wreck this day.</p>

<p>On the 18th we were busy in making a larger
tent with the sails we had got. We set up
two small spars at each end, and laid a studding
sail boom across the tops of them; over this
we spread a topsail, hung smaller sails at the
ends, and placed planks round the bottom, to
prevent them from being blown up by the
wind. With the soft moss of the island for
beds, and planks to sit upon, we now found
ourselves pretty comfortable in every respect
but one: All our attempts to kindle a fire proved
unavailing, and we were obliged to eat
our victuals raw. Observing a flight of large
birds, resembling ravens, carrying something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in their talons, we watched where they alighted,
and going to the spot, found several parcels
of pork and beef which they had picked
up, the barrels being staved by the rocks. In
this manner we procured about a dozen of
pieces. We again went off to the wreck in
the afternoon, to see what we could get on
shore, as it had every appearance of a gale of
wind, and managed to get three of our chests
out of the vessel before dark; and amongst
them mine. It contained only one shirt and
my bible, which I had put into one of those
squares, common in sailor’s chests, for holding
case bottles, and in which it was firmly
fixed, in consequence of having swelled with
the water. I was at great pains in drying it
in the sun, and succeeded so well that I could
read any part of it. It was afterwards saved
from a second wreck; and in my future hardships
and sufferings, the perusal of it formed
my greatest consolation. It is still in my possession,
being the only article I brought with
me when I returned to my native country.</p>

<p>We also secured this day, a barrel of fine
biscuit; it was soaked with salt water, but
was, nevertheless, a most acceptable addition
to our store. In the night, between the 18th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and 19th, it blew so hard from the south,
that the ship went to pieces before morning.
At day-break, we discovered on a small isle,
separated from the land by a channel which
was dry at low water, the fore part of the ship,
which had driven high up on the beach. Had
we been able to have moved it to a better situation,
it would have made an excellent hut;
but this was beyond our strength. It was
broken up and gradually removed when we
could afford time. Some more fragments of
the wreck, consisting of knees and planks,
came on shore this day. We also recovered a
few packages of nankeens and chests of tea,
which we spread on the moss to dry.</p>

<p>Our horizon to the south being interrupted
by the reef, the captain and mate went out in
the long-boat to determine the latitude by a
meridian altitude of the sun. The result of
the observations gave 54 deg. 52 min. north, as
the latitude of the south side of the island.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>We made a number of trips to the wreck in
the course of the ten following days, and saved
a considerable part of the cargo, consisting of
chests of tea, packages of nankeens, and bags
of rice. The last time we went off to the
wreck, before the arrival of the Indians, the
wind was off shore, and began to blow so fresh
that we were obliged to desist from our labours.
After having secured a few more sails, some
coils of cordage, and two bales of silks, having
only two oars and a heavy boat to row, we
reached the shore before dark, after a most
fatiguing pull. By this time so much of the
wreck was recovered that we determined to
build a vessel large enough to carry us to the
Sandwich Islands, where we were certain of
meeting with an American ship. Our principal
attention was now turned to that object,
and we began our preparations by collecting

<h2>CHAPTER III. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Arrival of a party of Natives, and of the Russian Commandant
of Oonalaska, who determines to send to Kodiak for
assistance&mdash;Long-boat prepared for the voyage&mdash;Some
account of Sannack or Halibut Island.</p></div>


<p>Our necessary occupations, and the unpromising
appearance of the country, had hitherto
prevented us from leaving the neighbourhood
of our hut; but we had seen nothing that
led us to imagine that the island was inhabited.
We were, however, visited on the 28th,
by a party of natives, who had traced the
fragments of wreck along shore.</p>

<p>About mid-day we saw them approach in
three small skin canoes, with one Indian in
each. One of them, who had a gold medal
about his neck, came forward, and addressed
us in the Russian language. The captain,
who had made a former voyage to these settlements,
and understood a few words of the
language, contrived to make our situation
known to him. He immediately despatched
one of his companions to a village on the
northern part of the island for assistance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the other to Oonalaska to give information to
the commandant of the Russian settlements on
that island.</p>

<p>The chief himself remained, and most willingly
gave us a share of his provisions, which
consisted of a bladder of train oil, and a basket
of berries, about the size of bilberries, preserved
in oil. These, to people in any other
situation, would scarcely have been deemed
an acquisition. Even we, who had lived so
long on raw muscles, found some difficulty in
reconciling ourselves to train oil; but we
thought the berries, which had been cured
with seal oil, no small luxury. This friendly
Indian, who had hooks and lines, went out in
his canoe, and in a short time returned with
a few small fish. He then kindled a fire in
the following manner: he laid a piece of
soft wood upon the ground, and took another
within his teeth; between these he put an
upright piece of a harder quality, which he
twirled rapidly around with a thong of hide,
as we would a drill; the friction soon kindled
the soft wood, and by placing it in
dried grass, and blowing it, it burst into a
flame.</p>

<p>We lost no time in broiling the fish, and en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>joyed
the first comfortable meal we had since
the shipwreck.</p>

<p>Next day about forty Indians, men and
women, came and encamped beside us; they
made huts for themselves, by setting up planks,
leaning against each other at the top, and
throwing earth upon them, over which they
put a covering of grass.</p>

<p>They brought a supply of provisions, consisting
of berries, oil, blubber, and dried salmon,
and gave us a share of all they had with
the utmost liberality.</p>

<p>By the assistance of the Indians, who towed
our boat with their canoes, we made two more
trips to the wreck, and were successful in saving
a considerable quantity of the cargo, as
well as several articles of greater use to us for
our intended vessel; such as bolts of canvass,
cordage, and other naval stores, being part of
the rigging of the ship that was stranded in
the harbor of St. Peter and St. Paul. In saving
these articles, the grappling-irons proved
of the greatest service; for though the wreck
lay in about three fathoms, the water was so
clear, when the wind was southerly, that we
could distinctly see what lay at the bottom. A
considerable part of the ship still held together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>In about a week after this, Mr. Bander, the
Russian commandant of Oonalaska, arrived
in a large skin canoe or baidare, with twenty
or thirty Indians, who also hutted themselves
beside us. The presence of so many visiters
formed a singular contrast to the solitude in
which we had hitherto lived. Our tent was
now in the centre of a busy and populous village.</p>

<p>Some of our new visiters erected huts,
whilst others contented themselves with sleeping
under their baidare, which they placed
bottom up, and raised by supports from the
ground on the lee side.</p>

<p>We were now in no want of provisions.&mdash;In
addition to what the Indians brought with
them, they procured us a plentiful supply of
fish and fowl, particularly geese, in which the
island abounded; these they shot with their
rifles, in the use of which they are very expert.</p>

<p>These rifles are no wider in the bore than
our own; but the metal is extremely thick,
particularly at the muzzle. They load them
almost full of powder, over which they force
a piece of lead, three or four inches long,
with a mallet; this comes out like an arrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
The piece is rested upon two supports, which
fold out, and are stuck in the ground. I have
seen them fire at the geese, which usually sat
in rows, and kill several at one shot.</p>

<p>Mr. Bander took possession of the ship’s
cargo. Under his directions we went off to
her several times, in company with the Indians,
and brought away a considerable quantity
of the nankeens and cloth; but were not
successful in getting provisions, for we secured
nothing except a few casks of damaged
bread, and half a puncheon of rum.</p>

<p>Our chief attention was now turned towards
our vessel, and we had a reasonable prospect
of completing her by the aid of our visiters.</p>

<p>From Oonalaska we procured twelve Indians
who could use the axe, and Mr. Bander
promised us the assistance of Russian carpenters
from Kodiak. To obtain which, as
well as to report the loss of the ship to the
governor of the Russian settlements, the long-boat
was fitted out for a voyage to Kodiak.&mdash;About
the 6th of November the necessary repairs
were begun.</p>

<p>The seams were payed with a composition
of the rosin that had been saved from the
wreck, and train oil, boiled to a consistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in the kettles of the Indians. A kind of spar
deck was formed, by laying the boards of the
hat boxes over the thwarts; and upon these
we nailed a tarpaulin: a hatch way was left
at the stern, by which we got below, and in
which the man at the helm could stand. We
laid a small platform on the bottom, and covered
it with skins; this formed a birth into which
we could creep, but it was too low to allow us
to sit upright. Out of the ship’s spanker I
made a suit of sails. She was rigged a sloop,
and provided with a cable and grapnel. She
was small enough for a voyage of 500 miles at
such a season, being only twenty-two feet
long, and measuring about six ton. She, however,
proved an excellent sea-boat.</p>

<p>Every thing being completed by the 17th,
we laid in our stores, consisting of dried salmon,
berries, and oil, with a cask of water,
and sailed on the following morning. The
crew consisted of Mr. Bartram, second mate,
myself, and seven more of the crew, one Indian,
who acted as pilot.</p>

<p>The island on which we had now remained
two months, is called by the natives Sannack;
by Captain Cook it is named Halibut Island.
It is situated in latitude 54. 27. north, longi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>tude
197. east, and lies 10 or 12 leagues to
the south of the promontory of Aliaski, and
about 60 east of Oonalaska. It is quite flat,
with the exception of two mountains, is eight
or ten miles long, and about six broad. The
main land could be distinctly seen; and the
remarkable volcano mentioned by Captain
Cook, bore N. N. W. from our tent. It was
constantly smoking during the day, and at
night we could frequently see the flames.</p>

<p>The land produces nothing eatable but berries.
To the south lies the dangerous reef
upon which we were wrecked; it is of great
extent, for when at the ship we observed breakers
a considerable distance to the southward.</p>

<p>There is a village of 12 or 15 Indian families
at the northern extremity of the island.&mdash;These
people are under the government of the
Russians, for whom they provide furs for the
American company. They are a quite inoffensive
race, converts to the Greek Church,
and if not very devout, are at least extremely
attentive to the ceremonial part of crossing
themselves.</p>

<p>Their appearance and manners will be afterwards
more particularly described. As the
whole of their sustenance, clothing, and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>deed,
every article they make use of, except
a few berries, are the produce of the sea, they
are extremely expert in managing their canoes,
and most ingenious in their modes of catching
fish and other sea animals. They are excellent
marksmen with the rifle and spear; to
the latter they fix a bladder, which prevents
the wounded animal from taking it under
water, and dart it with great force and certainty
by means of a throwing stick.</p>

<p>Like all other savages I have seen, they
are immoderately fond of spirits and tobacco.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Sail from Sannack in the long-boat&mdash;Touch at the Island
of Ungar&mdash;Distressing state of the settlement there&mdash;Sail
from thence&mdash;Anchor at the village of Schutkum&mdash;Departure
from it&mdash;Boat nearly embayed on the north
coast of Kodiak&mdash;Arrived at Alexandria&mdash;Transactions
there&mdash;Boat fitted out to return to Sannack.</p></div>


<p>We sailed from Sannack, in the long-boat,
on the morning of the 18th of November;
but had scarcely been an hour at sea, before
we discovered a leak in the counter, which
forced us to put back.</p>

<p>Having repaired the damage, we again set
sail next morning, with a fair southerly wind.
Our little vessel made better weather than
could have been expected, and so long as it
continued moderate, she scudded before the
sea perfectly dry; we boomed out the foresail
on the weather side, and the wind being fair,
proceeded on our voyage at a great rate.&mdash;About
noon it freshened into a smart gale, and
the sea rose considerably, frequently curling
over the stern in an alarming manner. Our
open cock-pit rendered this extremely danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>ous,
till we adopted an expedient of which I
fortunately recollected having read in the voyages
of some Dutch navigators, who used oil
to smooth the sea. Upon trying the experiment,
it proved an effectual remedy. We
lashed a keg of oil upon the taffrail, allowing
a small stream to run from it, which spread a
scum over the surface in our wake, and completely
prevented the waves from topping.</p>

<p>The coast of Aliaski which we passed this
day, is very mountainous, and deeply indented
with arms of the sea. Many small
islands lie near the shore, which are covered
with brushwood. Sometimes a temporary
hut erected by the hunters is to be seen, but
there were no other symptoms of inhabitants.
Extensive reefs of rocks lie a considerable
distance off the land; our pilot, who was well
acquainted with the navigation, took us within
them; but strangers should be very cautious
in approaching this part of the coast.</p>

<p>About ten at night we were close in with
an island of considerable height, and attempted
to pass to leeward, but were prevented by
breakers, which obliged us to tack and pass on
the outside. A round lofty rock lies a quarter
of a mile to the southwest; the channel within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
seemed also full of rocks, and we were obliged
to make another tack before we could weather
it. Our situation for about two hours after
this, was very alarming; we passed many
sunk rocks, and were repeatedly obliged to
tack in order to avoid them.</p>

<p>At day-break we found ourselves near a
barren island, four or five miles in length, lying
to the south of a larger one called Ungar.
We passed through the sound between them,
and, coasting along the southern shore of Ungar,
arrived about ten A. M. at a village, situated
on the eastern part of the island, after a
run of 160 miles.</p>

<p>We found the settlement here in the most
distressing situation. The whole of the male
inhabitants, except the Russian overseer and
his son, and the Indian interpreter, having
gone out to catch seals, about three weeks before
this time, a severe gale of wind came on,
which their slight canoes were unable to resist,
and every one of them perished. This dreadful
calamity did not prevent the survivors from
receiving us with the kindest hospitality. We
were lodged in the hot bath, which was effectually
warmed by the steam of water thrown
upon red-hot stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Ungar is nearly twenty miles in length; in
the interior the country rises into lofty mountains;
near the sea it is more level, and is
covered with brushwood, but produces no
vegetable food, except berries, and a root from
which the Russians make the liquor called
quass. We remained eight days at this place,
during which we went out several times to
shoot deer, with which the island abounds,
accompanied by the son of the overseer and
the interpreter; we had tolerable sport, and
the venison made a most acceptable addition
to our store.</p>

<p>The natives seem, in all respects, the same
as those at Sannack. The settlement consisted
of one Russian and about thirty Indian
families. The houses of the latter were built
of mud, in the form of a bee-hive, with a hole
at the top instead of a door; they had no fire-places,
but warmed themselves by means of
lamps made out of flat hollow stones, with
rush wicks, which when cold, they placed under
their frocks. One cooking place served
for the whole village.</p>

<p>This island is separated from the main land,
by a strait nearly ten miles wide at high water,
but so extremely shallow that it is said to dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
at low ebbs, when deer frequently pass over
from the continent.</p>

<p>The village is situated on the north side
of a small, well sheltered harbour, the entrance
to which is between two rocky heads,
not above a cable’s length asunder. Within
it is a quarter of a mile broad, and divides,
a short way above the village, into two
branches, one of which extends a considerable
distance to the west. There are three or
four high pointed rocks a little to the south
of the entrance, but there is deep water all
round.</p>

<p>We sailed on the morning of the 28th, with
the wind at N. W. and steered between the
main land and a small isle to the east of Ungar.
Before we reached the open sea, the
wind headed us, and blew with such violence
as to force us back to the harbour we left
in the morning. Gales from the N. E. with
heavy falls of snow, prevented us from sailing
for the eight following days. I employed myself
in making a squaresail out of a bolt of
canvass we had for the purpose.</p>

<p>Having laid in a store of deer’s flesh, dried
and boiled, the only provisions the place afforded,
we again sailed on the morning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
6th of December; the wind strong from the
west, with squalls, accompanied with snow
showers. The excessive cold made us feel
severely the want of a camboose, or fire place
in the boat.</p>

<p>We continued to coast along the main land,
within half a mile of the shore. Nothing
could exceed the barren aspect of the country,
which consisted of a range of steep and rugged
hills, destitute of wood, or almost any
appearance of vegetation. Many reefs lie a
considerable way off the land.</p>

<p>On the 7th we passed an island called St.
Ivan, the weather still very cold, with snow.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the wind veered to the
N. E. and blew with such violence that we
were driven out to sea; had the gale continued,
our situation would have been highly
critical; for our water was nearly expended,
and we were unprovided with a compass to
direct our course; fortunately, however, it
abated towards morning, when we tacked
and stood to the shore. About noon we were
close in with the land, and being anxious to
kindle a fire, anchored in a bay, where the
brushwood grew down to the water’s edge.
One of the Indians landed to cut firewood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
but, he was scarcely upon shore when three
bears made their appearance, and forced him
to swim back to the boat. We were reluctantly
obliged to desist; and having weighed
anchor, we went ten miles further, to a village
called Schutcum.</p>

<p>A number of sunk rocks lie about half a
mile to the south of this place, with an intricate
and narrow channel, through which we
were piloted by the overseer, who came out to
meet us in a bidarka.</p>

<p>After remaining here three days, we sailed
again on the 13th, having met with the same
hospitable treatment we had uniformly experienced
from these islanders. They liberally
supplied us with berries and oil, bear’s
flesh, and dried salmon. Soon after leaving
Schutcum, we doubled a bluff head, and
opened up a strait<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that separates Kodiak
from the main land; a short way beyond it
passed a narrow entrance leading into a spacious
bay or inlet; the pilot told us that it
stretched twenty or thirty versts<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
country, and afforded an excellent shelter for
ships. We then stood over to Kodiak, which
we reached in the evening; the wind W. S. W.
with fine weather; we run along shore during
the night. Next day, about two o’clock, we
passed near a rock, on which several outches,
or sea-lions, were sitting; some of them swam
towards us, uttering loud yells; but as the boat
was going at a great rate through the water,
we soon lost sight of them.</p>

<p>Soon after, whilst crossing a deep bay, the
wind checked round to the northwest, and
blew so hard at times as to oblige us to take
in all our sails. We endeavored to run under
the west point of the bay, where there seemed
to be good shelter; but we fell to leeward,
and were under apprehensions that we should
not be able to weather the point that formed
its eastern extremity. Mr. Bertram proposed
to run the boat ashore, but the surf was so
heavy, that the attempt would have been extremely
hazardous. I was of opinion that
we might weather the point by carrying sail,
and he allowed me to take the helm. Having
set our close-reefed mainsail and storm-jib,
the whole crew, except myself, went below,
and lay as much as possible to the weather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
side, by which means the boat was enabled
to carry sail till we cleared the head. After
this we had the wind upon our quarter, and
the evening proving fine, we made great progress.</p>

<p>The channel or strait, which separates Kodiak
from the continent, is about fifteen
leagues in breadth, and as far as I could
judge, is free from danger, except close in
shore.</p>

<p>We entered by moonlight the strait between
Kodiak and several smaller islands to the east,
with a strong tide in our favor, and were clear
of it before daylight.</p>

<p>Being in want of water, we landed early
in the morning, and having kindled a fire,
had a warm breakfast before embarking.&mdash;The
country here was well wooded with
pines, but we saw no inhabitants. We made
sail about eleven, and entered the harbour
of Alexandria before dark. We hoisted a
Russian jack which we had on board, upon
which a Baiderai came off and towed us in.
There were two ships and a brig at anchor in
the bay.</p>

<p>Alexandria is the principal Russian settlement
in the Fox islands, and the residence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the governor, upon whom we waited immediately
upon our landing, with our letters from
Mr. Bander.</p>

<p>He gave each of us a tumbler of brandy,
and sent us to the cazerne, or barracks, where
the Russian convicts lodged.</p>

<p>The brig which lay in the harbour was ordered
to be fitted out for Sannack, for the
purpose of taking in that part of the cargo
of the Eclipse which had been saved from the
wreck. As it would take a considerable time
before she could be got ready, the governor ordered
us to return in the boat with the carpenters
and tools required for our vessel, that no
time might be lost.</p>

<p>We remained here three weeks, and during
that time we were employed in preparations
for our return. The boards we had
nailed on the boat’s bottom were stripped
off, and she was thoroughly repaired by the
Russian carpenters. A camboose for our
fire was made, by sawing a cask in two,
and filling it with gravel, and secured by
lashing it to the mast. We also provided
ourselves with a compass, the want of which
we had experienced in our voyage thither,
our view of the land having been almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
constantly intercepted by fogs and snow showers.</p>

<p>Mr. Baranoff, the governor, gave us a chart
of the Fox islands and adjoining continent;
and furnished us with letters, in case we
should find it necessary to touch at any of the
Russian settlements; he also sent three carpenters
to assist in the construction of our
vessel.</p>

<p>By the 8th of January 1808, every thing
was completed, and we had laid in a good
stock of provisions, consisting of salted pork
and bear’s flesh, two skin bags of rusk, two
casks of water, and a keg of rum, with preserved
berries, and blubber for the Indians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Departure from Alexandria&mdash;Boat forced into a bay by the
weather, and hauled on shore&mdash;Obliged, by want of provisions,
to leave the bay&mdash;A snow storm&mdash;The boat
springs aleak&mdash;Is run on shore, and goes to pieces upon
the rocks&mdash;A hut discovered, in which the crew pass the
night.</p></div>


<p>We quitted the harbour of Alexandria on
the morning of the 9th of January, (O. S.)<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
on our voyage back to Halibut island.</p>

<p>With a fine breeze of southerly wind we
coasted along the northeast shore of Kodiak,
leaving on our right a cluster of islands which
lie to the eastward. Upon the largest, which
is called Afognac, I was informed there are several
Russian settlements.</p>

<p>This is the finest part of the island I have
seen, the country being covered with wood,
chiefly of the pine tribe, and many of the trees
of great size. The other islands are also well
wooded.</p>

<p>In the evening the wind died away, and
the tide turned against us when nearly half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
way through the straits. We anchored for the
night in a cove on the larboard side.</p>

<p>Next morning at daylight, we weighed, with
a strong breeze from the east, which soon carried
us clear of the strait. Upon reaching
the open sea, we shaped our course to the
northwest.</p>

<p>The headland or cape, which forms the extremity
on the starboard hand, is perfectly level
on the summit for nearly a mile, and terminates
in a lofty perpendicular cliff.</p>

<p>On the following day the wind changed to
the northwest, and blew hard, with a heavy
sea; as it was directly against us, with every
appearance of a gale coming on, we were
obliged to bear away for a harbour. At noon,
we reached a well sheltered bay, on the northern
side of Kodiak. From the threatening
appearance of the weather, it was judged prudent
to haul the boat on shore; and there being
no habitations within reach, we were under
the necessity of living on board.</p>

<p>The bay was surrounded by high mountains,
with a rocky shore, except at our landing
place, where there was a small extent of
sandy beach. The whole country was at this
time, many feet deep with snow, which pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>vented
us from making any distant excursions.
At this place we were forced by the weather to
remain ten days.</p>

<p>The dread of famine at last obliged us to
put to sea, although the state of the weather
was by no means favourable for the prosecution
of our voyage. The surrounding country
produced no food of any kind, and our
stock of provisions was nearly expended. We
left the bay, in hopes of reaching a settlement
called Karlouski, which lay at no great distance
to the west.</p>

<p>We launched the boat on the morning of
the 21st, and stood over towards the main
land. When about mid-channel, we discovered
that the boat had sprung a leak; at the
same time a heavy fall of snow came on, accompanied
with violent squalls. The leak
gained so much upon us, that it became absolutely
necessary to run for the nearest shore.&mdash;Had
the day been clear, we might have got
back to the harbour we had quitted in the
morning; but the snow rendered it so dark
that we could scarcely see a boat’s length
ahead; we had therefore no resource but to
put before the wind, and trust our lives to Providence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The first view we had of the shore was
most alarming; we were completely embayed,
with a heavy surf breaking amongst the
rocks, whilst, at the same time, the violence
of the gale, and the state of the boat, were
such as to preclude any hopes of working out
of the bay. We therefore turned the bow to
that part of the shore which seemed clearest of
rocks, and a sea carried us so far up, that when
it retired, we were left almost dry; the next
wave carried us a little further, upon which the
second mate imprudently let go the anchor;
when it retired we all jumped out, and reached
the shore in safety. Upon the return of the
swell, the boat swung round, with her head to
the sea, and being prevented by the anchor
from driving farther up, she almost immediately
went to pieces upon the rocks.</p>

<p>That part of the island on which we were
cast was quite barren, and many miles distant
from the nearest settlement, the path to which
lay across mountains covered with snow.</p>

<p>After collecting what we could save of the
wreck of the boat, we set out in search of some
place to shelter us for the night, and fortunately
discovered, at no great distance, one of those
huts that are constructed for the use of the fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and bear hunters. It was too small to admit
of a fire in the inside; but the number of people
crowded into it rendered the cold less
intense; and we lighted a fire in the open air,
at which we made ready our provisions.</p>

<p>Upon examining our remaining stock, we
found, that with the utmost economy, it would
not last above three or four days; it became
therefore necessary to form some plan to extricate
ourselves from so deplorable a situation.</p>

<p>The bay in which we were wrecked was
surrounded with high mountains, which ran
down to the shore, terminating in a steep range
of rocks, or what sailors call an iron bound
coast. Karlouski, the nearest settlement, lay,
as we were informed by our Russian companions,
at a considerable distance to the west.
We deliberated whether we should attempt to
reach it by crossing the mountains, or by going
along shore at low water. The danger and
difficulty of making our journey over the
snow deterred us from adopting the first plan:
we therefore fixed on the latter, and determined
to set out on our journey next morning.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 22d we quitted the
hut, leaving one of the Russians and our Indian
pilot to take charge of what we had saved
from the boat.</p>

<p>Having proceeded some distance, we were
interrupted by a reef of rocks, over which it
was necessary to wade. I was provided with
strong seal-skin boots, but unfortunately in
crossing they were filled with water, which,
the cold being so severe, the exercise of walking
did not prevent from freezing. In a
short time I lost all feeling in my feet, but was
able to keep up with my companions, till our
progress along shore was completely stopped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
by a mountain which projected into the sea.
Finding it impossible to get round the base,
we attempted to climb over the summit. It
was very steep, and in many places crusted
with ice. I had by this time entirely lost the
use of my feet, and with all my exertions, was
unable to keep pace with my companions.
In many places I was forced to dig steps in
the ice and snow, with a pair of boots I had
on my hands for that purpose. At length,
after great labour and fatigue, I gained what
I imagined to be the summit; it proved, however,
to be little more than half way up, and
the higher part of the mountain was quite inaccessible.
I endeavoured to descend again;
but in a short time found that the state of my
feet rendered the attempt unavailing. I had
no alternative but to slide down; and, therefore,
throwing away the boots, and placing my
hands behind me, to direct my course, I came
down with such velocity, that at the foot of
the hill, I sunk at least ten feet into the frozen
snow. I was at first almost suffocated, till I
made a little room by pressing the snow from
me. I called as loud as I was able for assistance,
but could not make my companions
hear me, although I heard their voices per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>fectly
well calling upon me. I at length relieved
myself, by compressing the snow till it
became sufficiently hard to bear my weight.
I then planted my feet into it, and reached
the surface.</p>

<p>We turned back, and endeavoured to proceed
by a valley which lay behind the mountain.
My feet by this time were frozen, never
to recover; and I was so ill able to ascend,
that I was frequently blown over by the wind,
and sometimes driven a considerable way
down the hill. Exhausted by these fruitless
trials to keep up with the rest, I became totally
unable to proceed, and was left to my fate.
I laid myself down on the snow in a state of
despair. Having recovered a little, I resolved
to make another attempt to follow the track of
my companions, but had not proceeded far
when I met them coming down the hill, which
had proved to be impassable.</p>

<p>We now set off on our return to the hut,
but were soon interrupted by a steep rock,
which the rising tide prevented us from passing.
We had no resource, but to wait till low
water next day, and to pass the night where
we were. This was a most unfortunate circumstance
for me, for had I reached the hut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and got my feet dried, they would in all likelihood
have recovered. It blew hard, and the
night was piercingly cold; we therefore returned
to the valley, where there was at least
some shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>The Russians, who knew the effects of cold,
informed us that the consequences of lying
down would be fatal. Although well aware of
this, I was so much overcome by cold and fatigue,
that I several times dropt asleep upon
my feet; but my companions, who had not
suffered so much, took care to arouse me.</p>

<p>Next morning we again set off for the hut,
and met with no interruption till we came to
the reef where I had got my feet wet. In consequence
of the high wind, the swell was
heavier than it had been the day before, and
my feet were so powerless that a wave washed
me completely off the reef into deep water.
It was fortunately towards the shore, and on the
returning wave I recovered my footing, and
succeeded in getting over.</p>

<p>I followed my companions as well as my
exhausted strength and the state of my feet
would permit, but fell considerably behind,
and had entirely lost sight of them, when
my progress was impeded by a projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
crag, through which a natural perforation
formed the only passage. The entrance was
elevated a considerable way from the ground,
and that part of the rock over which it was
necessary to scramble, was nearly perpendicular,
and almost covered with ice.</p>

<p>With a little assistance I could have easily
got over; but situated as I was, my own exertions
were of little avail. My feet were of
no use in climbing, and I was obliged to drag
myself up by my hands, in doing which they
also were frozen. After many ineffectual attempts,
I had, as I thought, gained the top;
but when I had tried to lay hold of a projection
in the rock, my fingers refused to perform
their office, and I fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The tide was fast rising, and the surge already
washed the spot where I stood; in a
few minutes it would have been too late, and
I must have perished had I been obliged to remain
another tide, with my feet and hands
frozen, and my whole body wet. As a last
resource, I collected a few stones, which I had
just strength to pile sufficiently high to enable
me to get over.</p>

<p>This took place early in the day, and the
hut was only a few miles farther on, but I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
so much enfeebled that I did not reach it till
dusk.</p>

<p>I never again walked on my feet; but, by
the blessing of God, recovered the use of my
hands, with the loss of only two fingers.</p>

<p>I was treated with great humanity upon my
arrival, by the Russians, who had preserved
their clothes dry in seal skin bags. They gave
me a suit, and having cut off my boots, wrapped
my feet and hands in flannel drawers. I
was laid upon a bed of dried grass, after having
satisfied my hunger with some rusk and
blubber, which were the only provisions that
remained.</p>

<p>As our stock was so low, no time was to be
lost in procuring assistance; accordingly, the
two who had remained set out next morning
to endeavor to reach the settlement by the
mountains.</p>

<p>On the third day after their departure our
provisions were completely exhausted; but
the weather had been tolerable, and we knew
that if they succeeded, they would lose no
time in sending us relief.</p>

<p>On the 27th, those who had been on the
look out brought the joyful intelligence that
five canoes were in sight, which proved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
have been sent by our companions, who had
reached the village in safety.</p>

<p>We quitted the hut on the 28th, in the canoes,
which were baidarkas, with three seats
in each. In crossing a bay we encountered a
heavy sea; in order to keep me dry I was put
below, and the hole in which I sat was stuffed
up with the gut frock.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to me when we got into
smoother water, for the space into which I
was crammed was so small that I had nearly
been suffocated. We arrived at Karlouski in
the evening.</p>

<p>This settlement consisted of about thirty Indian
families, and several Russians; the latter
lived together in a cazerne, and the Indians in
huts, which at this place were built of logs,
wood being plenty. I was carried to the cazerne,
where I was laid upon a bed of skins,
and treated with the utmost attention; but as
the place afforded no medical assistance, my
feet and hands began to mortify, and my
health was otherwise so much impaired, that
I was frequently in a state of delirium.</p>

<p>We remained here till about the 25th of February,
when we took our passage in a baiderai,
or large skin-boat, bound to Alexandria,
with a cargo of furs, berries, oil, and fish.&mdash;They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
had for provisions the salmon-roe, preserved
in train oil, and kept in bladders. This
is by them esteemed a delicacy, but it was too
strong for my stomach.</p>

<p>The first night we landed at a village constructed
differently from any I had hitherto
seen; the whole of the houses, except the
roofs, were under ground, and communicated
with each other by a subterraneous passage.
Bad weather, and contrary winds, detained us
at this place eleven days.</p>

<p>We sailed again on the 7th of March. The
wind being fair we hoisted a squaresail, and
ran before it at a great rate. There is a group
of small islands abreast of the south point of
North-Island, at which place the tides meet,
causing a heavy breaking sea; and as the baiderai
was deeply loaded, it had a frightful appearance.
The frame of the vessel was so
extremely slight, that when between the waves,
she was bent into a deep curve, and whilst on
the top of the wave the two ends were as
much depressed. I was in constant apprehension
that the frame would give way. She
however, went through the sea drier than a
stiffer vessel would have done, and we reached
the harbour of Alexandria on the 9th, without
any accident.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival at Alexandria I was immediately
carried to the hospital. The surgeon,
on examining my feet, found them in a
state of mortification; he used poultices of
rye, and other applications, for several days,
in hopes of effecting a cure. On the second
day he cut off one of my fingers; I lost a joint
of another, but all the rest recovered.</p>

<p>Finding no favourable symptoms in my
feet, he informed me I must submit to lose
them in order to save my life. I had no idea
that the case was so hopeless, and was not
prepared for such an alternative. I requested
three days to consider. At the end of that
time I told him I had made up my mind, and
would submit to the operations. Accordingly
he amputated one of them on the fifteenth
of March, and the other on the seventeenth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
April following. Unfortunately for me he
cut them off below the ankle joint, from a
wish to take as little away as possible; the
sores extended above the place, and have never
completely healed. By the month of August
I could creep about on my hands and
knees.</p>

<p>My case excited great compassion, and a
subscription was raised for me by Governor
Baranoff and the officers of the ships that lay
in the harbour, which amounted to one hundred
and eighty rubles.</p>

<p>Whilst in the hospital, the brig arrived that
had been despatched to Sannack for the goods
saved from the wreck. With her came Mr.
Bander, and also the mate and boatswain of
the Eclipse, who had left Captain O’Cain in
consequence of a difference that had taken
place. They informed me that he had nearly
completed the vessel, which was a brig
of about seventy tons, and that he would find
no difficulty in manning her with Russians
and Indians. I afterwards heard from some
Indians, who had come with despatches
from Oonalaska, that the vessel was launched,
and had sailed from Sannack. What became
of her afterwards, I never could learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with certainty, but it was reported that she
had foundered at sea, and all on board perished.</p>

<p>The mate, second mate, and boatswain, left
Kodiak in a ship called the Neva, bound for
Sitcha, an island near Norfolk Sound, where
the Russians have lately established a settlement,
from whence, I understand, they went
to China in an American ship.</p>

<p>Mr. Baranoff, the governor, went to Sitcha
at the same time, leaving Mr. Bander in
charge of the colony.</p>

<p>When I had tolerably recovered my strength,
I was employed by that gentleman in teaching
eight Indian children the English language,
in order that they might be qualified to
act as interpreters to the American ships that
frequently touch at these islands. My pupils
were between the ages of eight and thirteen,
and had all been taught the Russian language,
of which, by this time, I understood a
little.</p>

<p>I had to labour under great difficulties for
want of books and grammars, and was obliged
to form the letters of the alphabet in the
best manner I was able. This was no easy
task to me, both from want of practice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the state of my right hand, which I could
with difficulty open or shut. I however succeeded
in teaching them to read the letters,
but my farther progress was interrupted by
my departure from the island. I have very
little doubt of my ultimate success, had I remained,
for the boys were uncommonly quick
and apt to learn.</p>

<p>The island of Kodiak is the principal possession
of the Russians on the northwest coast
of America. It is above a hundred miles long,
from northeast to southwest, and about fifty
across at the wider part; but its breadth is
very irregular, the shore being indented with
deep bays and inlets.</p>

<p>The climate is by no means favourable; the
snow lies on the ground till the end of April,
and although the cold in winter is not very intense,
the season is seldom free from fogs, snow,
or rain. The summers are also very wet, and
subject to frequent fogs.</p>

<p>Kodiak contains but a scanty population, the
inhabitants are scattered through eight or ten
villages upon the coast, and are employed in
collecting furs for the Russian American Company.
These villages, in general, consist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
a few Indian families, who are under the
charge of a Russian overseer.</p>

<p>No part of the island is cultivated, except a
garden or two near the town, and a little barley
at the village of Superscoff. It contains,
however, a great deal of fine timber, chiefly
larches, spruces, and other kinds of pine. Many
of the trees are large enough to make spars
of considerable dimensions.</p>

<p>Alexandria,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the principal town on the
island, and the residence of the governor, is
situated on the eastern side of an extensive
bay. It possesses an excellent harbour, being
well sheltered by several small islands that lie
to the southwest. The eastern entrance, which
is the safest, is not above a mile wide, and is
defended by a battery or small fort. There is
also an entrance to the west; but it is narrow
and intricate, and requires a leading wind to
pass through.</p>

<p>The town consists of about fifty houses, built
of logs, the seams of which are calked with
moss, and the roofs thatched with grass; they
are, in general, divided into three apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
below, and as many on the upper story. They
are heated by stoves or ovens; when the wood
is reduced to ashes, the vent is closed by means
of a slide fitted for the purpose, and the heated
air then diffusing itself through the room, renders
it extremely comfortable. The windows,
instead of being glazed, are covered with
pieces of the gut of the seal, split up and sewed
together; this, after being well oiled, is
stretched on a frame, and defended from the
wind by cross-bars on each side. Talc is also
used for the same purpose. This substance is
found in flakes about the size of the palm of
the hand, and several of these are puttied together
to form a pane.</p>

<p>About sixty Indians reside at this place; they
live in a large circular building or barrack,
called the Cazerne Aleuskoi.</p>

<p>The town also possesses a church, a barrack
for the Russian convicts, a school, and several
storehouses belonging to the N. W. Company.</p>

<p>At the school the children of the natives are
taught the Russian language, writing, and
arithmetic; there were about fifty scholars,
and as far as I could judge, from the few under
my charge, there is no difficulty in teaching
them these acquirements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, as at Kamschatka, most of the Russians
are married to native women.</p>

<p>This is the principal depot of the American
Company;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the furs collected at the different
settlements on the coast are sent here, and
lodged in the Company’s stores till ships arrive
to carry them to Kamschatka, whence
they are sent to China, or overland to St Petersburgh.</p>

<p>The natives, in return for the furs which
they procure for the Company, receive cloth,
powder and shot, beads, toys, and articles of
luxury, such as rum, tobacco, and snuff, of
which they are immoderately fond.</p>

<p>A considerable trade is carried on with the
Americans who call at these islands. Their
ships take on board a certain number of natives,
with their baidarkas, and implements of
fishing and hunting. They then proceed to
the coast of California, where there is great
abundance of fur seals, and otters, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the assistance of the Indians, generally complete
their cargoes in two seasons. On their
return the American Company are entitled to
a certain proportion of their furs, as an equivalent
for the labour of the Indians. The
Eclipse was on a voyage of this description,
when chartered by the Russians to bring a
cargo from China.</p>

<p>A few miles to the west of Alexandria,
there is another village called Superscoff, the
property of a Russian of that name, who had
been settled there above fifteen years. From
this place the town of Alexandria derives its
principal supply of salmon and dried fish.&mdash;They
had a herd of black cattle consisting of
seventy, all sprung from one cow which Superscoff
brought with him. The milk, butter,
and cheese, used at the town, were brought
from this place.</p>

<p>Their stock of cattle, having been but recently
introduced, is too small to admit of their
slaughtering any, and bear’s flesh is the only
fresh meat consumed upon the island. The
bears are either shot or caught in traps; the
trap is merely a piece of board, about two
inches thick, and two feet square, stuck
full of spikes, barbed, and kept extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
sharp; this is set in their paths, and covered
with dust; from the weight of the animal,
when he sets down his foot, the spikes enter
it; to assist himself in pulling the first away,
he plants another on the trap, and continues
his exertions, till, at last, all his four feet are
transfixed, when he falls on his back, and is
taken.</p>

<p>The natives of the Fox islands, or Aleuskoi,
as they are called by the Russians, are low
in stature, broad in the visage, with dark eyes
and hair.</p>

<p>The principal article of their dress is a large
frock called a parka, made of fur or skin, frequently
of the skins of sea-fowls, which they
wear with the feathers out during the day,
and next their skin at night. This piece of
dress is nearly the same in both sexes. When
at sea, they wear a frock of another kind,
called a camelengka, made of the gut of the
seal, to which a hood is attached, and tied
close round the face, the sleeves being equally
tight at the wrist. Upon their limbs they frequently
wear boots and breeches in one piece,
made of seal hide, over which the camelengka
is fastened close, so that their dress is perfectly
water-proof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>They are extremely fond of ornaments,
particularly beads, with which the women
decorate themselves in great profusion, sewing
them round the neck, skirts, and wrists of
their skin frocks. They also wear them in
their ears, or suspend them from a hole made
in their under lip, and sometimes hang them
round each end of a bone about five inches
long, which they pass through the gristle of
the nose, called by sailors their spritsail-yard.
They do not tattoo themselves like the Sandwich
islanders, but they often paint or rather
daub their faces in streaks, with red ochre and
train oil.</p>

<p>Their canoes are made of the skin of sea-lions,
stretched over slight wooden frames;
Those of the largest size, called baiderais, are
open, and can contain sixty or seventy people;
the smaller kind, called baidarkas, being quite
close, have a hole in the covering, or deck, for
each sitter, and carry one, two, or three persons.
They are rowed either with double-bladed
paddles, which are held by the middle,
or by single-bladed ones, with crutch handles,
which are shifted to each side alternately;
the rowers sit with their faces to the bow,
and pull them with great swiftness. It is won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>derful
what long voyages they make in these
slight boats; several of them came from Oonalaska
to Kodiak during my stay in that
island. No water can get into them in the
roughest weather, for the camelengka, a gut
frock, which Indians wear when at sea, is
stuffed tight round them at the hole. From
their flat construction, and extreme lightness,
the weight of the people sitting in these canoes,
renders them top heavy, and many accidents
arise from their oversetting. In this respect,
the single-holed ones are much the safest, for
even when overset, a slight exertion is sufficient
to right them.</p>

<p>In catching seals, and other amphibious animals,
these people show great dexterity and
ingenuity. Concealing themselves behind
rocks, they decoy them by throwing a seal
skin, blown out like a bladder, into the sea.
To this is fixed a line made of the sinew of
the whale, by which they draw it to them,
when it is followed by the seals, who take it
for an animal of their own species. As soon
as within reach, they are killed with spears or
bows and arrows.</p>

<p>The natives, as I have already observed,
are converts to the Greek church, but their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
religion consists in little more than crossing
themselves, whenever they enter a house; they
are however, abundantly superstitious, and
put complete faith in the predictions of their
shamans, or astrologers. Whilst I was there
an eclipse of the moon took place, on which
occasion they confidently affirmed that it was
the sign of great events happening in Europe.
Indeed, not only the natives, but the Russians
themselves seemed to be of the same opinion;
and the next ship bringing intelligence of war
between England and Russia, served to confirm
their belief.</p>

<p>The food of the natives consists of fish, fresh
or dried, principally salmon; blubber, or
whale fat; whale and seal oil; the flesh of
seals and other amphibious animals; and berries
preserved in oil.</p>

<p>In consequence of this diet, as well as the
state of filth in which they live, they are very
liable to the scurvy; indeed, few of them are
free from ulcers and scorbutic eruptions.</p>

<p>On the return of the Neva from Sitcha, she
was ordered to be prepared for a voyage to the
Sandwich Islands, and was provided with a
supply of adzes, hatchets, teeth of the sea-horse,
and other articles suited for that market.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>It would appear that the Russians had determined
to form a settlement upon these islands;
at least, preparations were made for
that purpose; and I was informed by the
commandant, that if I chose, I might get a
situation as interpreter. The ship had a house
in frame on board, and intimation was given
that volunteers would be received; none, however,
offered; and I never observed that any
other steps were taken in this affair.</p>

<p>Being sure of meeting with American vessels
at the Sandwich Islands, in which I might
get to Europe or America, I expressed a desire
to embrace this opportunity of quitting Kodiak,
and was accordingly permitted to take my
passage in the ship.</p>

<p>The Neva had a crew of seventy-five seamen,
belonging to the Russian imperial service,
and was commanded by captain Hageimeister,
who had been bred in the British navy, and
could speak English fluently. The ship herself
was British built, and had made a voyage
round the world.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>The preparations for the expedition being
completed, we left the harbour on the 11th of
December, O. S. with a fair wind, and soon
lost sight of the island.</p>

<p>We proceeded on our voyage to the Sandwich
Islands, and enjoyed fine weather, with
favourable winds.</p>

<p>No land was seen from the time we quitted
the Fox Islands, till the 27th of January.</p>

<p>On that morning, at day break, we discovered
the mountains of Owhyhee, at the distance
of ten leagues. In the afternoon, we
were close in with the land, and coasted along
the north side of the island.</p>

<p>The breeze being light, several canoes
came from the shore with fresh provisions.
We stood off and on for some time, carrying
on a brisk trade with the natives; amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
other things supplied by them, we were surprised
to find sheep and goats, the breed of
which, although but recently introduced, has
increased so rapidly that they already form an
article of trade.</p>

<p>We passed the foot of Mouna-kaa,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> one
of the highest mountains in the world. The
sides are extremely steep, and although situated
within the tropics, the summit is perpetually
covered with snow; a narrow tract
of level ground lies between the base of the
mountain and the sea, terminating in high
abrupt clifts; presenting at a distance a most
barren appearance. On a nearer approach,
however, we could observe numerous patches
of cultivated land, and the lower parts of the
mountain covered with wood. Farther to
the west, the plains are of greater extent, the
country well wooded, and in a high state of
cultivation; with many villages and houses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
presenting every appearance of a numerous
and industrious population.</p>

<p>Mouna-roa,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> one of the mountains in the
interior, is a volcano; a few years before this
time a violent eruption took place, when it
sent forth a stream of lava which ran into the
sea. Isaac Davis, with whom I afterwards
resided, and who had gone in a canoe to witness
it, informed me that where the lava joined
the sea, the heat was so intense that he could not
approach nearer than fifty yards. We did not
see any flame or smoke issuing from the crater.</p>

<p>We made sail in the evening, and reached
Mowee the following day.</p>

<p>Whilst running along the southeast side of
the island, several canoes came off with refreshments.
In one of them was a white man,
calling himself Joseph Wynn, an American.
He had resided several years upon the island,
where he had a family, and cultivated a piece
of land, which had been granted to him by
Crymakoo, a powerful chief.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that his real name was
Angus Maccallum, a native of Houstoun, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Renfrewshire. Having served with his brother
in the Diana frigate, and coming from the
same part of the country, a great degree of
intimacy naturally took place between us, and
we had much conversation together.</p>

<p>Amongst other things, I told him that I understood
the Russians had some intention of
forming a settlement on the Sandwich islands.
This reached the captain’s ears; and he gave
me a severe reprimand, for having, as he
expressed it, betrayed their secrets. He desired
me to say no more on the subject in
future, otherwise I should not be permitted to
quit the ship.</p>

<p>I know not what obstacle prevented this
plan from being carried into effect; but although
the Neva remained several months in
the country, I never heard any more of the
settlement.</p>

<p>We came to anchor in the harbour of Lahina.
The captain went ashore and returned
with a supply of fresh provisions. I wished
much to have accompanied him, but the surf
rendered the landing too difficult for one in
my helpless condition.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah, king of Owhyhee, Mowee,
Wahoo, and the adjoining islands, resided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
some years at this place. His house, which
we could distinctly see from the ship, was
built of brick, after the European manner. Of
late, he has fixed his residence at Wahoo; upon
learning of which, the captain determined
to proceed thither.</p>

<p>The island of Mowee is of great height. At
a distance it appears like two islands; a low
flat piece of land running completely across,
and dividing it into two peninsulas. Maccallum
informed me that it was very fertile; that
provisions were abundant, and much cheaper
than at either Owhyhee or Wahoo.</p>

<p>We weighed on the morning of the 29th,
and passing between the islands of Morokai
and Ranai, reached the harbour of Hanaroora,
on the south side of Wahoo, the same evening.</p>

<p>A number of natives came off, as usual, the
moment the ship hove in sight. King Tamaahmaah
was in a large double canoe; on
his coming along side, he sent his interpreter
on board to announce his arrival.</p>

<p>The captain immediately went to the gangway
to receive his majesty, and shook hands
with him when he came upon deck.</p>

<p>He was, on this occasion, dressed as a European,
in a blue coat and gray pantaloons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately on his coming aboard, the king
entered into earnest conversation with the
captain. Amongst other questions, he asked
whether the ship was English or American?
being informed that she was Russian, he answered,
“Meitei, meitei,” or, very good. A
handsome scarlet cloak, edged and ornamented
with ermine, was presented to him from
the governor of the Aleutian islands. After
trying it on, he gave it to his attendants to be
taken on shore. I never saw him use it afterwards.
In other canoes came Tamena, one
of his queens, Crymakoo, his brother-in-law,
and other chiefs of inferior rank.</p>

<p>My appearance attracted the notice, and
excited the compassion of the queen; and
finding it was my intention to remain upon
the islands, she invited me to take up my residence
in her house. I gladly availed myself
of this offer, at which she expressed much
pleasure; it being a great object of ambition
amongst the higher ranks to have white people
to reside with them. When the ship was
brought to anchor, she sent me ashore in one
of her canoes.</p>

<p>Captain Hagemeister recommended me at
the same time to the notice of the king, by in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>forming
him, that I could not only make and
repair the sails of his vessels, but also weave
the cloth of which they were made.</p>

<p>The king assured him that I should be
treated with the utmost kindness. It will be
seen in the sequel how well he performed his
promise.</p>

<p>Upon landing I was much struck with the
beauty and fertility of the country, so different
from the barrenness of the Fox islands. The
village of Hanaroora, which consisted of several
hundred houses, is well shaded with large
cocoa-nut trees. The king’s residence, built
close upon the shore, and surrounded by a pallisade
upon the land side, was distinguished by
the British colours and a battery of sixteen carriage
guns, belonging to his ship, the Lily Bird,
which at this time lay unrigged in the harbour.
This palace consisted merely of a range of
huts, viz. the king’s eating-house, his sleeping-house,
the queen’s house, a store, powder-magazine,
and guard-house, with a few huts
for the attendants, all constructed after the
fashion of the country.</p>

<p>At a short distance were two extensive storehouses,
built of stone, which contained the European
articles belonging to the king.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I was conducted to the house occupied by
the two queens. It consisted of one large
apartment, spread with mats; at one end of
which the attendants of both sexes slept, and
at the other the queens occasionally slept when
the king was in the morai.</p>

<p>They and their attendants always eat here,
and Tamena wished me to join them; but as
I had been informed by Crymakoo, that if I
did so, I should not be allowed to eat with
men, I resolved to decline her offer.</p>

<p>The Neva remained in the harbour three
months, during which time I ate my victuals
on board. At the end of that period, having
completed a cargo of provisions, consisting of
salted pork and dried taro root, she sailed for
Kodiak and Kamschatka. I was then invited
by the king to take my meals in his eating-house,
and at the same time he desired a young American,
of the name of William Moxely, a native
of Norfolk in Virginia, who understood the
language, to eat along with me, to act as my
interpreter. The king’s mode of life was very
simple; he breakfasted at eight, dined at noon,
and supped at sunset.</p>

<p>His principal chiefs being always about his
person, there were generally twenty or thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
persons present; after being seated upon
mats spread on the floor, at dinner a dish of
poe, or taro pudding, was set before each of
them, which they ate with their fingers instead
of spoons. This fare, with salt fish and consecrated
pork from the morai, formed the
whole of the repast, no other food being permitted
in the king’s house. A plate, knife
and fork, with boiled potatoes, were, however,
always set down before Moxely and me, by
his majesty’s orders. He concluded his meal
by drinking half a glass of rum; but the bottle
was immediately sent away, the liquor being
tabooed, or interdicted to his guests. The
breakfast and supper consisted of fish and
sweet potatoes.</p>

<p>The respect paid to the king’s person, to
his house, and even to his food, formed a remarkable
contrast to the simplicity of his mode
of living.</p>

<p>Whenever he passed, his subjects were
obliged to uncover their heads and shoulders.
The same ceremony took place upon
their entering, or even passing his residence;
and every house which he entered was ever
after honoured with the same marks of respect.
Once, when employed in the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of Isaac Davis, making a loom for the king,
I observed him passing, and being ignorant of
this custom, requested him to enter and observe
my progress; but he declined doing so,
informing me of the consequence. He, therefore,
seated himself at the door, till I brought
out my work for his inspection.</p>

<p>When his food was carrying from the cooking-house,
every person within hearing of the
call Noho, or, sit down, given by the bearers,
was obliged to uncover himself, and squat
down on his hams.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>This ceremony was particularly inconvenient
when the water used in the king’s house
was carried past; there being none of a good
quality near Hanaroora, it was necessary to
bring it from the mountains, a distance of five
miles. The calabash carriers were obliged,
when any person appeared in sight, to call out
Noho. They, however, ran past as quick as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
they could, not to detain his majesty’s subjects
in so unpleasant an attitude.</p>

<p>White people were not required to pay these
honors, though scrupulously exacted from the
natives.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah was most attentive in performing
the duties of religion, and constantly
attended the morai on the taboo days, which
took place about four times each month. The
ceremonies lasted one day and two nights;
during which time no person was permitted
to pass the bounds of the morai.</p>

<p>When the king was absent on these occasions,
I did not experience the same attention
as at other times; the attendants became very
remiss in providing my dinner, and I was
sometimes obliged to go without it altogether.</p>

<p>I accompanied the king once to the morai;
but not relishing the confinement, and being
unwilling to make complaints, I removed,
about the beginning of May, to the house of
Isaac Davis, a Welshman, who had been about
twenty years upon the island, and remained
with him till the king gave me a grant of land
about six months afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis arrived at the Sandwich islands
as mate of a small American schooner. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
captain, a very young man, having incautiously
permitted the natives to go on board,
without any restriction, a chief, of the name
of Tamahmotoo, observing this, planned her
capture. For which purpose a number of
natives, under various pretences, crowded
into the vessel, and, upon a signal being given,
threw the whole crew, five in number, into
the sea. Davis, being an excellent swimmer,
laid hold of one of the canoes, from which,
however, he was beat off by paddles. He
swam to another, where the natives also attempted
to beat him off; but being a stout,
athletic man, he was able to keep his hold.
Having no arms, they attempted to put him
to death, by holding him under the water,
and beating him with their paddles; and also
endeavoured to strangle him, by placing his
neck across one of the beams of the canoe,
and trampling upon him. But by this time
the rest of the crew having been destroyed,
and the schooner taken possession of, they
relented, and ceased to torment him any
farther. He was carried ashore blind, and
almost lifeless, and it was eighteen months
before he recovered his sight. He told me,
that, before this time, he had never believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
in the existence of a God, and had led a very
sinful life; that, upon the near prospect of
death, the idea of his offences filled him with
terror; and that he tried to repeat the Lord’s
Prayer, and felt himself strengthened after
doing so.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah, who was at a distant part of
the island, was extremely indignant at Tamahmotoo
when he heard of this outrage.</p>

<p>He took the vessel from him for the purpose
of restoring her to her owners, and showed the
utmost kindness to Davis. Nearly at the same
time another Englishman, of the name of
Young, was detained upon the island.</p>

<p>These two constantly attached themselves
to Tamaahmaah; and, from their knowledge
of fire-arms, proved of essential service in the
expeditions in which he conquered Mowee,
Morotoi, and Wahoo.</p>

<p>They were rewarded, by being raised to the
rank of chiefs, and received extensive grants
of land.</p>

<p>When Tamaahmaah removed to Wahoo,
Davis accompanied him, and he left Young as
governor of Owhyhee. These two he always
treated with greater confidence than any of
the native chiefs. Davis had extensive grants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of land on several of the islands. Upon Wahoo
alone he had estates on which were four or
five hundred people, who cultivated the land,
and paid him a rent in kind. These were
exempted from the taxes paid by the other
chiefs for their lands; but Davis frequently
made the king presents of feather cloaks, and
other valuable articles.</p>

<p>He was married to a native woman, by
whom he had no children. By a former wife
he had three, two of whom were left under
the charge of Mr. Young of Owhyhee. His
house was distinguished from those of the
natives only by the addition of a shed in front
to keep off the sun; within, it was spread
with mats, but had no furniture, except two
benches to sit upon. He lived very much like
the natives, and had acquired such a taste
for poe, that he preferred it to any other food.
We had, however, at all times abundance of
pork, goat’s flesh, and mutton, and frequently
beef sent by Young from Owhyhee; and in the
mornings and evenings we had tea. His wealth,
consisting of mats, feathers, and cloth, the produce
of the island, and a large assortment of
European articles, which he had acquired by
trading with the ships that touched here; these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
were contained in a large storehouse, built of
stone, adjoining his dwelling.</p>

<p>My first employment was to overhaul the
sails of the king’s vessels, and to repair such as
were out of order. After working two or three
months at this, he desired me to make some
canvass.</p>

<p>Having informed him that a loom was necessary,
he ordered Boyd, his principal carpenter,
to make one. This, however, Boyd
declined, from an illiberal notion held by
many of the white people, that the natives
should be taught nothing that would render
them independent of strangers. He told the
king he did not know how to make looms;
upon which I undertook to make one myself;
although, by so doing, I incurred the displeasure
of many of my countrymen. Davis
had a native servant called Jack, who worked
as a Tailor, and was a very handy fellow.
This man showed much anxiety to observe
how I proceeded; but his master told me by
no means to allow him, as he was so quick
he would soon learn to make a loom himself.
When I said I had no wish to make it a secret,
he replied, that if the natives could weave
cloth, and supply themselves, ships would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
no encouragement to call at the islands. Another
instance of this narrow way of thinking
occurred, when a brother of the queen’s, whose
name I do not remember, but who was usually
called by the white people, John Adams, wished
me to teach him to read, Davis would not
permit me, observing, “they will soon know
more than ourselves.”</p>

<p>The making of the loom, from want of assistance,
and want of practice, proved a very
tedious job. I succeeded tolerably well at
last; and having procured a supply of thread,
spun by the women from the fibres of the plant
of which their fishing lines are made, I began
my operations.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> After working a small piece, I
took it to the king as a specimen. He approved
of it in every respect except breadth, which
was only about half a yard, saying, he wished
it made wide enough for an awning to a ship.
This was beyond my power; but I told him I
could make it a yard wide, and then sow it up
into any size. He accordingly ordered me to
make a loom of the necessary dimensions.&mdash;The
small piece I wove he kept, and showed
it to every captain that arrived as a specimen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the manufacture of the country. I had nearly
finished the other loom, when the ship arrived
in which I quitted the island.</p>

<p>During the time I resided with Davis, Terremytee,
the king’s brother, died. His body
lay in state for a few days, in the morai; and
was afterwards buried, according to custom,
in a secret manner.</p>

<p>The public mourning that took place on
this occasion was of so extraordinary a nature,
that, had I not been an eye-witness, I could
not have given credit to it.</p>

<p>The natives cut off their hair, and went
about completely naked. Many of them,
particularly the women, disfigured themselves
by knocking out their front teeth, and branding
their faces with red hot stones, and the
small end of calabashes, which they held
burning to their faces till a circular mark
was produced; whilst, at the same time, a
general, I believe I may say an universal, public
prostitution of the women took place; the
queens and the widow of the deceased alone
exempted.</p>

<p>When the captain of a ship that lay in
the harbour remonstrated with the king upon
these disgraceful scenes, he answered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
such was the law, and he could not prevent
them.</p>

<p>About this time an immense water-spout
broke in the harbour. It was first observed
in the south, about noon. The day was fine,
with a clear atmosphere, and nearly calm.
When I saw it first, it appeared about the
thickness of a ship’s mast, reaching from the
sea to a heavy dark cloud that hung immediately
over it. It approached slowly, the
cloud gradually increasing in size. When it
came near, we could observe the water
ascending in a spiral direction, and the sea
round its base boiling up in great agitation.
At this time it seemed about the thickness of
a hogshead. The tide was fortunately out;
and upon crossing the reef, about an hour
after its first appearance, the column broke,
and such a mass of water fell, that the sea
in the harbour was raised at least three feet
upon the beach. No squall was experienced,
nor did any rain fall. Hundreds of dead fish
were picked up upon the reef, and along shore
after it broke. I have seen several water-spouts
at sea, and one that was nearly on
board the ship in which I was, but none of
them at all equal in magnitude to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives quitted their houses, and fled
with the utmost precipitation in a direction
opposite to that in which it approached. I
was informed, that a few years before, one
had broken on the north side of the island, by
which a number of houses were washed away
and many people drowned.</p>

<p>In the month of November the king was
pleased to grant me about sixty acres of land,
situated upon the Wymummee, or Pearl-water,
an inlet of the sea about twelve miles to
the west of Hanaroora. I immediately removed
thither; and it being Macaheite time,
during which canoes are tabooed, I was carried
on men’s shoulders. We passed by foot-paths,
winding through an extensive and fertile
plain, the whole of which is in the highest
state of cultivation. Every stream was
carefully embanked, to supply water for the
taro beds. Where there was no water, the
land was under crops of yams and sweet potatoes.
The roads and numerous houses are
shaded by cocoa-nut trees, and the sides of
the mountains covered with wood to a great
height. We halted two or three times, and
were treated by the natives with the utmost
hospitality. My farm, called Wymannoo, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
upon the east side of the river, four or five
miles from its mouth. Fifteen people, with
their families, resided upon it, who cultivated
the ground as my servants. There were three
houses upon the property: but I found it most
agreeable to live with one of my neighbours,
and get what I wanted from my own land.
This person’s name was William Stevenson,
a native of Borrowstounness. He had been
a convict, and escaped from New South
Wales; but was, notwithstanding, an industrious
man, and conducted himself in general
with great propriety. He had married a native,
and had a family of several children.&mdash;He
was the first who introduced into the
island the mode of distilling a spirit from the
tee-root, of which, however, he became so
fond, that the king was obliged to deprive
him of his still. When I knew him he had
bound himself by an oath, not to taste spirits
except at the new year, at which time he indulged
to the greatest excess. He chiefly employed
himself in his garden, and had a large
stock of European vegetables.</p>

<p>In the end of February, I heard there was
a ship at Hanaroora, and went up with a canoe-load
of provisions, wishing to provide my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>self
with some clothes, and, if possible, a few
books. She proved to be the Duke of Portland,
South-sea whaler, bound for England.
When I learned this, I felt the wish to see my
native country and friends once more so
strong, that I could not resist the opportunity
that now offered. In addition to these motives,
the state of my feet had of late given
me considerable uneasiness; the sores had
never healed, and I was anxious for medical
assistance, in the hopes of having a cure performed.
I was, indeed, leaving a situation of
ease, and comparative affluence, for one where,
labouring under the disadvantage of the loss
of my feet, I knew I must earn a scanty subsistence.
I was a tolerable sail-maker; and
I knew, that if my sores healed, I could gain
a comfortable livelihood at that employment.
These hopes were never realized; the state of
my limbs renders me quite unable to hold a
bolt-rope, and necessity has compelled me to
betake myself to a more precarious and less
agreeable occupation.</p>

<p>The king was on board the ship at the time,
and I asked his permission to take my passage
home. He inquired my reason for wishing
to quit the island, and whether I had any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
cause of complaint. I told him I had none;
that I was sensible I was much better here
than I could be any where else, but that I was
desirous to see my friends once more. He
said, if his belly told him to go, he would do
it; and that if mine told me so, I was at liberty.</p>

<p>He then desired me to give his compliments
to King George. I told him that, though born
in his dominions, I had never seen King
George; and that, even in the city where he
lived, there were thousands who had never
seen him. He expressed much surprise at
this, and asked if he did not go about among
his people, to learn their wants, as he did?
I answered, that he did not do it himself, but
that he had men who did it for him. Tamaahmaah
shook his head at this, and said,
that other people could never do it so well as
he could himself.</p>

<p>He sent a handsome cloak of feathers by
Captain Spence as a present to his majesty,
accompanied by a letter, which I heard him
dictate to the captain. The purport of it was
to remind him of Captain Vancouver’s promise,
that a man of war, armed with brass
guns, and loaded with European articles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
should be sent to him; and added, that he
was sorry he was so far away that he could
not help him in his wars; and concluded, by
requesting his acceptance of the cloak as a
proof of his regard.</p>

<p>Having procured the king’s permission to
depart, I went on shore to take leave of my
friends; particularly Isaac Davis, and my patroness,
the queen, who had always treated me
with the utmost kindness. On this occasion
she presented me with several valuable mats
to sleep upon on board the ship.</p>

<p>It will be believed that I did not leave Wahoo
without the deepest regret. I had now
been thirteen months upon the island; during
which time I had experienced nothing
but kindness and friendship from all ranks&mdash;from
my much honoured master, the king,
down to the lowest native. A crowd of people
attended me to the boat; unaccustomed to
conceal their feelings, they expressed them
with great vehemence; and I heard the lamentations
of my friends on shore long after
I had reached the ship.</p>

<p>We sailed next day, being the 4th of March.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Description of Wahoo&mdash;Extent&mdash;Whyteete-bay&mdash;Account
of Tamaahmaah’s navy&mdash;Town and harbour of Hanaroora&mdash;Bass’s
harbour&mdash;Wymumme, or Pearl-river&mdash;State

white people resident on the island.</p></div>


<p>The island of Wahoo lies about seven
leagues to the northwest of Morotai, and
about thirty from Owhyhee, in the same
direction; it is nearly forty miles in length
from northwest to southeast, and almost half
that extent in breadth.</p>

<p>Although only of secondary size, it has
become the most important island in the
groupe, both on account of its superior fertility,
and because it possesses the only secure
harbour to be met with in the Sandwich
islands.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, and of the facility
with which fresh provisions can be procured,
almost every vessel<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that navigates the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Pacific puts in here to refit. This is probably
the principal reason why the king has
chosen it as his place of residence; perhaps
the vicinity to Atooi and Onehow, the only
islands independent of himself, and the conquest
of which he is said to meditate, is another
and no less powerful motive.</p>

<p>The south coast of the island extends from
Diamond-hill on the east, to Barber’s Point<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
on the west, a distance of about twenty-four
miles. A range of mountains run almost
parallel to the shore, from which it is separated
by a fertile plain, which varies in
breadth; at Hanaroora, where it is broadest,
the distance from the sea to the mountains is
about five miles.</p>

<p>A reef of coral runs along the whole extent
of this shore, within a quarter of a mile
of the land; the greater part of it dries at low
water, and in the inside it is in many places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
too shallow even for canoes, except at full
tide.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Whyteete bay, where captain Vancouver
anchored, is formed by the land falling back
from the southern promontory of the island,
called by the white people Diamond-hill. It
is open to the south one half of the compass,
and there being no channel, ships are obliged
to anchor on the outside of the reef.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah formerly resided at this place,
and great part of his navy were hauled up on
the shore round the bay. I counted more
than thirty vessels; they are kept with the
utmost care, having sheds built over them,
their spars laid alongside, and their rigging
and cables preserved in stores.</p>

<p>They are chiefly sloops and schooners,
under forty tons burden, and have all been
built by his own carpenters, principally na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>tives,
under the direction of an Englishman of
the name of Boyd.</p>

<p>He possesses one ship of about two hundred
tons, called the Lily Bird. This vessel
was originally an American, which arrived
from the coast of California in a leaky condition.
He purchased her from the captain,
by giving his largest schooner in exchange,
and paying the difference in dollars. She
was repaired by his own carpenters, and laid
up at Hanaroora, along side a wharf built for
the purpose. The remainder of his fleet, ten
or twelve more, were hauled up at the same
place, except one small sloop, which he kept
as a packet between Wahoo and Owhyhee.
She was navigated by native seamen, under
the command of an Englishman, of the name
of Clerk, who had formerly been mate of the
Lily Bird.</p>

<p>Three miles to the west of Whyteete is the
town of Hanaroora, now the capital of the
island, and residence of the king. The harbour
is formed by the reef, which shelters
it from the sea, and ships can ride within
in safety in any weather, upon a fine sandy
bottom. There is a good channel through
the reef, with three or four fathoms water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
but if there is a swell it is not easily discovered,
as the sea often breaks completely
across. Pilots, however, are always to be
had; John Hairbottle, captain of the Lily
Bird, generally acted as such. The best
anchorage is in five fathoms water, about
two cables length from the shore, directly
in front of the village. Ships sometimes anchor
on the outside of the reef, but they run
the risk of having their cables cut by the
coral.</p>

<p>The entrance to this harbour may probably,
at no very distant period, be filled up by
the growth of the coral, which must be rapid
indeed, if Hairbottle, the pilot, was correct,
when he informed me that he knew a difference
of three feet during the time he had
been at Hanaroora.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>A small river runs by the back of the village,
and joins the sea at the west side of the
harbour; owing to the flatness of the country,
the water is brackish, and there is none
fresh to be had within several miles of the
place. Ships, however, can be supplied at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a moderate rate by the natives, who bring it
from the spring in calabashes.</p>

<p>Six miles to the westward is Bass’s harbour,
also formed by an entrance through the
reef; within it is well sheltered, with good
anchorage in five or six fathoms; but there
being no village in the vicinity, it is little
frequented.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Wymumme, or Pearl river, lies about seven
miles farther to the westward. This inlet
extends ten or twelve miles up the country.
The entrance is not more than a quarter of
a mile wide, and is only navigable for small
craft; the depth of water on the bar, at the
highest tides, not exceeding seven feet; farther
up it is nearly two miles across. There is an
isle in it, belonging to Manina, the king’s interpreter,
in which he keeps a numerous flock
of sheep and goats.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>
<p>Pearls and mother-of-pearl shells are found
here in considerable quantity. Since the
king has learned their value, he has kept the
fishing to himself, and employs divers for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Ten miles to the west of this is Barber’s
Point, (so called from the captain of a ship
wrecked there,) the northwest extremity of
the island. It is very low, and extends a considerable
way into the sea.</p>

<p>The tides upon this coast do not rise more
than four feet at springs; it is high water
about three at full and change of the moon.
The force of the current is scarcely perceptible.</p>

<p>The flat land along shore is highly cultivated;
taro root, yams, and sweet potatoes,
are the most common crops; but taro forms
the chief object of their husbandry, being the
principal article of food amongst every class
of inhabitants.</p>

<p>The mode of culture is extremely laborious,
as it is necessary to have the whole
field laid under water; it is raised in small
patches, which are seldom above a hundred
yards square; these are surrounded by embankments,
generally about six feet high, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sides of which are planted with sugar-canes,
with a walk at top; the fields are intersected
by drains or acqueducts, constructed with
great labour and ingenuity, for the purpose
of supplying the water necessary to cover
them.</p>

<p>The ground is first carefully dug and levelled
with a wooden spade, called maiai, which
the labourers use, squatting on their hams and
heels. After this, it is firmly beat down by
treading it with their feet till it is close enough
to contain water.</p>

<p>The plants are propagated by planting a
small cutting from the upper part of the root
with the leaves adhering. The water is then
let in, and covers the surface to the depth
of twelve or eighteen inches; in about nine
months they are ready for taking up; each
plant sends forth a number of shoots, or suckers,
all around. This mode of culture is particularly
laborious, and in all the operations
those engaged are almost constantly up to the
middle in the mud.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, I have often seen the
king working hard in a taro patch. I know
not whether this was done with a view of
setting an example of industry to his subjects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Such exertion could scarcely be thought necessary
amongst these islanders, who are certainly
the most industrious people I ever saw.</p>

<p>The potatoe and yam grounds are neatly
inclosed by stone walls, about eighteen inches
high. In addition to these native productions,
Indian corn, and a great variety of garden
stuffs have been lately introduced, and are
cultivated with success, chiefly by the white
people.</p>

<p>When the islands were discovered, pigs and
dogs were the only useful animals they possessed;
but Tamaahmaah has paid so much
attention to the preservation of the breeds left
by Vancouver, and other navigators, that in a
short time the stock of horned cattle, horses,
sheep, and goats, will be abundant.</p>

<p>At Owhyhee I was informed that there
were many hundreds of cattle running wild,
and several in a domestic state. The king
had introduced the breed into Wahoo; and at
the time I was there he had a herd of nine or
ten upon the north side of the island.</p>

<p>Sheep and goats are already very numerous.
Several individuals had large flocks of
them. The queen had one, consisting of
about one hundred and fifty; and Manina had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
several hundreds on the island in Pearl river.&mdash;The
king had five horses, of which he was
very fond, and used frequently to go out on
horseback. I was informed there were still
more at Owhyhee.</p>

<p>The cattle lately introduced are pastured
upon the hills, and those parts of the country
not under cultivation, the fences not being sufficient
to confine them. The hogs are kept in
pens, and fed on taro leaves, sugar canes, and
garbage.</p>

<p>The chiefs are the proprietors of the soil,
and let the land in small farms to the lower
class, who pay them a rent in kind, generally
pigs, cloth, or mats, at four terms in the year.</p>

<p>At one time during my stay, there were
nearly sixty white people upon Wahoo alone;
but the number was constantly varying, and
was considerably diminished before my departure.
Although the great majority had
been left by American vessels, not above one
third of them belonged to that nation; the
rest were almost all English, and of these six
or eight were convicts, who had made their
escape from New South Wales.</p>

<p>Many inducements are held out to sailors
to remain here. If they conduct themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with propriety, they rank as chiefs, and are
entitled to all the privileges of the order; at
all events, they are certain of being maintained
by some of the chiefs, who are always anxious
to have white people about them.</p>

<p>The king has a considerable number in his
service, chiefly carpenters, joiners, masons,
blacksmiths, and bricklayers; these he rewards
liberally with grants of land. Some of
these people are sober and industrious; but
this is far from being their general character;
on the contrary, many of them are idle and
dissolute, getting drunk whenever an opportunity
presents itself. They have introduced
distillation into the island; and the evil consequences,
both to the natives and whites, are
incalculable. It is no uncommon sight to see
a party of them broach a small cask of spirits,
and sit drinking for days till they see it
out.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few exceptions to
this. William Davis, a Welshman, who resided
with Isaac Davis, used to rise every morning
at five, and go to his fields, where he commonly
remained till the same hour in the evening.
This singularity puzzled the natives
not a little; but they accounted for it, by sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>posing
that he had been one of their own countrymen,
who had gone to Caheite, or England,
after his death, and had now come back to his
native land.</p>

<p>There were no missionaries upon the island
during the time I remained in it, at which I
was often much surprised.</p>

<p>Most of the whites have married native women,
by whom they have families; but they
pay little attention either to the education or to
the religious instruction of their children. I
do not recollect having seen any who knew
more than the letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>The manners and customs of the Sandwich
islanders have been repeatedly described
by much abler observers; but my long residence
has given me opportunities of noticing
many things which have escaped others; and
to these I shall, as much as possible, confine
my remarks.</p>

<p>The natives, although not tall, are stout
and robust in their make, particularly those of
the higher rank; their complexion is nut-brown,
and they are extremely cleanly in their
persons. They are distinguished by great ingenuity
in all their arts and manufactures, as
well as by a most persevering industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>They are divided into two great classes:
the Erees, or chiefs, and the Cannakamowree,
or people. The former are the proprietors of
the land, the latter are all under the dominion
of some chief, for whom they work, or cultivate
the ground, and by whom they are supported
in old age. They are not, however,
slaves, or attached to the soil, but at liberty to
change masters when they think proper.</p>

<p>The supreme government is vested in the
king, whose power seems to be completely
absolute. He is assisted by the principal
chiefs, whom he always keeps about his person;
many of these have particular departments
to attend to; one chief took charge of
the household, and appointed the different
surveys to be performed by every individual;
another, named Coweeowranee, acted as paymaster;
his province was to distribute wages
and provisions amongst the people in the
king’s service.</p>

<p>An elderly chief, of the name of Naai, took
a general charge of the whole, and was, in
fact, prime minister. He was commonly
called Billy Pitt by the white people, and was
by no means pleased when they addressed
him by any other appellation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal duties of the executive were,
however, entrusted to the priests; by them
the revenues were collected, and the laws
enforced. Superstition is the most powerful
engine by which the latter purpose is effected;
actual punishment being rare. I knew only
one instance of capital punishment; which
was that of a man who had violated the sanctity
of the morai. Having got drunk, he
quitted it during taboo time, and entered the
house of a woman. He was immediately
seized, and carried back to the morai, where
his eyes were put out. After remaining two
days in this state, he was strangled, and his
body exposed before the principal idol.</p>

<p>The method of detecting theft or robbery,
affords a singular instance of the power of
superstition over their minds. The party who
has suffered the loss applies to one of the
priests, to whom he presents a pig, and relates
his story.</p>

<p>The following ceremony is then performed;
the priest begins by rubbing two pieces
of green wood upon each other, till, by the
friction, a kind of powder, like snuff, is produced,
which is so hot, that on being placed
in dry grass, and blown upon, it takes fire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with this, a large pile of wood is kindled,
and allowed to burn a certain time. He then
takes three nuts of an oily nature, called
tootooee; having broken the shells, one of
the kernels is thrown into the fire, at which
time he says an anana, or prayer; and while
the nut is crackling in the fire, repeats the
words Muckeeroio kanaka ai kooee, that is,
kill or shoot the fellow. The same ceremonies
take place with each of the nuts, provided
the thief does not appear before they are consumed.</p>

<p>This, however, but seldom happens; the culprit
generally makes his appearence with the
stolen property, which is restored to the owner,
and the offence punished by a fine of four
pigs. He is then dismissed, with strict injunctions
not to commit the like crime in
future, under pain of a more severe penalty.
The pigs are taken to the morai, where they
are offered up as sacrifices, and afterwards
eaten by the priests.</p>

<p>Should it happen that the unfortunate criminal
does not make his appearance during the
awful ceremony, his fate is inevitable; had he
the whole island to bestow, not one word of
the prayer could be recalled, nor the anger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the Etooah appeased. The circumstance is
reported to the king, and proclamation made
throughout the island, that a certain person has
been robbed, and that those who are guilty
have been prayed to death.</p>

<p>So firm is their belief in the power of these
prayers, that the culprit pines away, refusing
to take any sustenance, and at last falls a sacrifice
to his credulity.</p>

<p>The priests also practice medicine. Bathing
is their great specific. If the patient is
too weak to be carried to the sea, he is washed
with salt water. The oil extracted from
a nut, called tootooee, is used as a purgative;
and a black mineral substance, reduced
to a powder, as an emetic. This is very
powerful in its effects; half the quantity that
can be laid on a sixpence forming a sufficient
dose.</p>

<p>I have but few particulars to give of their
religious opinions. Their principal god, to
whom they attribute the creation of the world,
is called Etooah; and they have seven or
eight subordinate deities, whose images are
in the morai, and to whom offerings are made
as well as to the Etooah. Their names I cannot
recollect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>They believe in a future state, where they
will be rewarded or punished for their conduct
in this life. Their belief in the efficacy
of prayer has already been remarked. During
the time I lived with the king, it was reported
that some person had prayed him to
death; in order to counteract the effects of
this, the daughter of a chief prostrated herself
before the house, and turning towards the
setting sun, prayed with great fervency. I
did not then understand the language, and
imagined that she was addressing that luminary;
but William Moxely explained that
part to me. She said, How could the sun rise
and set, or the moon perform her revolutions,
if there were not some superior Being who
regulated their motions.</p>

<p>They have a tradition of a general deluge.
According to their account, the sea once overflowed
the whole world, except Mouna Kaa,
in Owhyhee, and swept away all the inhabitants
but one pair, who saved themselves on
that mountain, and are the parents of the
present race of mankind.</p>

<p>Their morais, or places of worship, consist
of one large house, or temple, with some
smaller ones round it, in which are the im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>ages
of their inferior gods. The tabooed, or
consecrated precincts, are marked out by
four square posts, which stand thirty or forty
yards from the building. In the inside of the
principal house there is a screen or curtain
of white cloth, hung across one end, within
which the image of Etooah is placed. When
sacrifices are offered, the priests and chiefs
enter occasionally within this space, going in
at one side and out at the other. Although
present on one occasion, I did not enter this
recess, partly because I was doubtful of the
propriety of doing so, and also on account of
the difficulty I had in moving myself, and the
risk of getting my wounds injured among the
crowd.</p>

<p>On the outside are placed several images
made of wood, as ugly as can be well imagined,
having their mouths all stuck round
with dog’s teeth.</p>

<p>Their holidays took place about four times
a month, and the ceremonies lasted from
sunset on the day preceding, to sunrise on
the following day; during which no person
was permitted to pass the bounds of the morai.
This time was spent in prayer, in sacrificing
pigs, in eating the sacrifices, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
conversation. I attended only once, and was
not, at that time, sufficiently master of the
language to understand the purport of the
prayers.</p>

<p>The priest continued nearly three hours, in
a very solemn manner, during which the most
profound silence was observed; indeed, the
smallest noise of any kind, either within the
morai or in the neighbourhood, would have
been a proof that the deity was offended, and
the prayer must have ceased; a proclamation
was, therefore, made by the public crier,
whenever the king entered the morai, ordering
every animal near it to be confined, otherwise
they should be seized and offered up as
sacrifices. Those present stood with their
arms extended towards heaven for about three
quarters of an hour at the beginning of the
prayer, and the same length of time at its conclusion.
I was not required to perform this
part of the ceremony.</p>

<p>The number present did not exceed forty,
and were all of the higher rank. Women
are never permitted to attend on these occasions.</p>

<p>Human sacrifices are offered upon their
going to war; but nothing of the kind took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
place during my stay; unless in the case already
mentioned, of the man punished for
breaking the taboo, and whose body was exposed
before the idol.</p>

<p>During the period called Macaheite, which
lasts a whole month, and takes place in November,
the priests are employed in collecting
the taxes, which are paid by the chiefs in
proportion to the extent of their territories;
they consist of mats, feathers, and the produce
of the country. The people celebrate
this festival by dancing, wrestling, and other
amusements.</p>

<p>The king remains in the morai for the whole
period; before entering it, a singular ceremony
takes place. He is obliged to stand till
three spears are darted at him: He must
catch the first with his hand, and with it ward
off the other two. This is not a mere formality.
The spear is thrown with the utmost
force, and should the king lose his life, there is
no help for it.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>At the Macaheite, which happened when I
was on the island, the eldest son of Tamaahmaah,
a youth about fifteen, was invested with
royal honours, and entitled to the same marks
of respect as his father. What share he had
in the government I did not learn; but I observed
no alteration in the exercise of the
king’s authority.</p>

<p>The houses of the natives are of the simplest
form; they are oblong, with very low
side-walls, and high-thatched roofs; within,
they are not divided into separate apartments,
nor have they any tables or seats.</p>

<p>It is only by size that the houses of the
chiefs are distinguished from those of the
lower orders, for the same barn-like shape is
universal. They are, however, kept very
clean; and their household utensils, consisting
of wooden dishes and calabashes, are
hung, neatly arranged, upon the walls. While
the floors of the meaner houses are bare, except
the place for sleeping, where a few mats
are spread, those of the higher orders are
entirely covered over with mats, many of
which are worked with great elegance into
different patterns. At one end, a platform
raised about three feet from the ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
which extends the whole breadth of the apartment,
is spread with a layer of rushes, and
covered with mats. This forms the sleeping
place for the upper part of the family; the attendants
sleep at the opposite end.</p>

<p>As the two sexes never eat together, the
chiefs have always a separate eating-house, and
even the lower ranks have one to every six or
seven families for the men. The women take
their food in the same houses in which they
sleep.</p>

<p>Few of the houses, except the largest, have
any windows; the light being admitted by the
door, which is seldom closed. The dwellings
of the upper ranks are generally surrounded
by a paling. In all of them the utmost attention
to cleanliness prevails.</p>

<p>Their mode of cooking has been often
described. Poey, or taro-pudding, which is
the principal food of all ranks, is prepared by
baking the root in a pit with hot stones, upon
which water is poured. It is afterwards
scraped, mashed, and mixed with cold water.
When newly made, it is not unpalatable, but it
soon turns sour.</p>

<p>Fish are often eaten raw, seasoned with
salt water. When cooked, they are either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
done in their usual manner, under ground, or
broiled, by putting them, wrapt in leaves, upon
the fire. When the leaves are burnt, they
consider them ready.</p>

<p>They preserve pork by taking out the bones,
and rubbing it well with salt; after which it is
made up in rolls, and dried.</p>

<p>They frequently eat with their pork a kind
of pudding made of taro-root, which is previously
cut in slices, and dried in the sun; it
keeps a great length of time, and is a good
substitute for bread. In this state it is preferred
by the white people. The natives preserve
it for taking to sea, by mashing and forming
it into a solid paste, when it is wrapped in
leaves, and will keep fresh for five or six
weeks.</p>

<p>The sugar-cane, which they chew, is also a
general article of food.</p>

<p>Instead of candles, the tootooee-nut is used,
which being of an oily nature, yields a considerable
quantity of light. It grows upon a
small tree, and is about the size of a horse-chesnut.
When pulled, they are thrown into
water, and those that sink are reckoned
sound; they are then baked under ground,
and their shells broken off, in which state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
they are kept till required. When used as
candles, they string twenty or thirty upon a
slit of bamboo, each of which will burn five
or six minutes; but they require constant
trimming, and it is necessary to reverse the
torch whenever a nut is consumed, that the one
under it may catch fire. It must, therefore, be
held by a person whose business it is to keep it
always in order.</p>

<p>This nut, when pressed, yields an oil well
adapted for mixing with paint. The black
colour, by which their canoes are painted, is
produced by burning the nuts after they are
pressed, and by the cinders of the torches,
which are carefully preserved for the purpose;
these are reduced to powder, and mixed with
oil.</p>

<p>Ava, with which the natives were formerly
wont to intoxicate themselves, is now giving
way to the use of ardent spirits. I never saw
it used, except as a medicine to prevent corpulency,
and is said to be an effectual remedy.
It causes a white scurf to strike out upon the
skin, somewhat like the dry scurvy.</p>

<p>The spirit distilled from the tea-root now
usurps its place, and I fear the consequences
will be still more pernicious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>That plant grows wild in the upper part
of the country, and varies from the size of a
carrot to that of a man’s thigh. It is put into
a pit, amongst heated stones, and covered
with plantain and taro leaves; through these
a small hole is made, and water poured in;
after which the whole is closed up again, and
allowed to remain twenty-four hours. When
the root has undergone this process, the
juice tastes as sweet as molasses. It is then
taken out, bruised, and put into a canoe to
ferment; and in five or six days is ready for
distillation.</p>

<p>Their stills are formed out of iron pots,
which they procure from American ships, and
which they enlarge to any size, by fixing several
tier of calabashes above them, with their
bottoms sawed off, and the joints well luted.
From the uppermost, a wooden tube connects
with a copper cone, round the inside of
which is a ring with a pipe to carry off the
spirit. The cone is fixed into a hole in the
bottom of a tub filled with water, which serves
as a condenser.</p>

<p>By this simple apparatus a spirit is produced,
called lumi, or rum, and which is by
no means harsh or unpalatable. Both whites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and natives are unfortunately too much addicted
to it. Almost every one of the chiefs
has his own still.</p>

<p>Smoking tobacco is another luxury of which
the natives are very fond. The plant grows
in abundance upon the islands, and they use
it in a green state. In their tobacco pipes
they display their usual taste and ingenuity.
The tube is made of a hollow stem of a kind
of vine, fixed to an iron bowl, which is inserted
into hard wood. The stem is covered with
rings of ivory and turtle-shell, placed alternately;
the whole kept firmly together at the
top by an ivory mouth-piece.</p>

<p>The women are subject to many restrictions
from which the men are exempted. They
are not allowed to attend the morai upon
taboo days, nor at these times are they permitted
to go out in a canoe. They are never
permitted to eat with the men, except when
at sea, and then not out of the same dish.
Articles of delicacy, such as pork, turtle,
shark, cocoa-nuts, bananas or plantains, are
also forbidden. Dog’s flesh and fish were
the only kinds of animal food lawful for them
to eat; but since the introduction of sheep and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
goats, which are not tabooed, the ladies have
less reason to complain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rigour with which
these ceremonies are generally observed, the
women very seldom scruple to break them,
when it can be done in secret; they often
swim off to ships at night during the taboo;
and I have known them eat of the forbidden
delicacies of pork and shark’s flesh. What
would be the consequence of a discovery I
know not; but I once saw the queen transgressing
in this respect, and was strictly enjoined
to secrecy, as she said it was as much
as her life was worth.</p>

<p>Their ideas of marriage are very loose;
either party may quit the other when they
tire or disagree. The lower classes in general,
content themselves with one wife; but
they are by no means confined to that number,
and the chiefs have frequently several.
Tamaahmaah had two, besides a very handsome
girl, the daughter of a chief, educating
for him. One elderly chief, Coweeooranee,
had no fewer than fifteen. They are very
jealous of any improper connexion between
natives and their wives; but the case is widely
different with respect to their visitors, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
connexion of that kind is reckoned the surest
proof of friendship, and they are always anxious
to strengthen it by that tie.</p>

<p>The virtue of the king’s wives is, however,
most scrupulously guarded; each of them having
a male and a female attendant, whose duty
it is to watch them on all occasions. Should it
be discovered that any of the queens have
been unfaithful, these attendants are punished
with death, unless they have given the first
intimation.</p>

<p>Immediately after child-birth, women are
obliged to retire to the woods, where they remain
ten days, and must not be seen by the
men. The queen, who had a daughter whilst
I was there, had a house for the purpose of
retirement; but, in general, they have no other
shelter but what the woods afford. They also
retire in the same manner three days in every
month.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>A simple garment, called pow, forms the
principal part of the dress of the women; it
consists of a piece of cloth about one yard
broad and three in length, wrapped several
times round the waist, with the end tucked
in below, and reaching to the calf of the leg.
In cold weather, they throw another piece of
cloth, like a plaid, over their shoulders. Round
the neck they often wear wreaths of the leaves
of a fragrant plant called miri, resembling
those of the vine.</p>

<p>An ivory ornament, called palava, is very
generally worn, suspended by a hair necklace,
neatly plaited into small cords. The hole
through which it is passed is large enough to
admit the thumb, and the plaits are so numerous
as to fill it entirely.</p>

<p>The hair is combed back in front, and
plastered over with a kind of lime made from
burnt shells. This practice bleaches that on
the forehead nearly white.</p>

<p>Their heads are adorned with wreaths of
flowers taken from the stalk, and strung on
the stem of a small creeping plant. They
prefer purple, yellow, and white, and arrange
them alternately three or four inches of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
colour. This is twined several times round
the head, and has a very elegant appearance.</p>

<p>They are at great pains in ornamenting
themselves, for which purpose every female is
provided with a small mirror. All ranks pay
the utmost attention to personal cleanliness.</p>

<p>The dress of the men consists merely of a
small girdle, made of taper, called the maro.
Upon great occasions, the chiefs wear elegant
cloaks and helmets of red and yellow feathers.</p>

<p>The cloth called taper is entirely manufactured
by women, and is made from a bark of
a tree, which is first steeped in water, and
then beat out with a piece of wood, grooved
or furrowed like a crimping machine. The
bark is laid upon another piece of wood,
grooved like the former. As these two instruments
are at right angles during the operation,
the marks in the cloth are crossed like warp and
woof.</p>

<p>It is colored with the juice of berries, laid
on with a piece of turtle-shell, shaped like
a knife, or with a brush, formed by chewing
the end of a slip of bamboo. In this manner
it is tinged brown, green, blue, and
black; to produce a yellow, the cloth is
dipt in a dye prepared by boiling the cone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of a tree in water. They often paint a variety
of patterns, in which they display great
taste and fancy.</p>

<p>This cloth, from its texture, is, when wetted,
extremely apt to get damaged, in which
state it tears like moist paper; great care,
therefore, is always taken to keep it dry, or
to have it carefully dried when it is wetted.
When they swim off to ships, they hold their
clothes out of the water in one hand, occasionally
changing it as it becomes fatigued.</p>

<p>The mats with which the floors of the
houses are covered, are also manufactured by
the women. They are made of rushes, or a
kind of broad-leaved grass, split at the stem,
and are worked in a variety of patterns.</p>

<p>The natives are most dexterous fishers, and
their implements are constructed with much
ingenuity. The hooks are sometimes made
of mother-of-pearl and tortoise-shell, but those
procured from ships are coming into more general
use.</p>

<p>Their nets and lines are spun from the fibre
of a broad-leaved plant called ourana, similar
in appearance to sedge or flags; it is pulled
green, and the outside stripped off with a tortoise-shell
knife, after which it is steeped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
water; the fibres are separated by the nail,
and spun into lines, by rolling them between
the hand and the thigh. The lines have sometimes
two strands, and sometimes three, and
are much stronger than those of hemp. They
drag these lines after their canoes, and in this
manner take bonettas, dolphins, and albicores.
For the hooks of their own manufacture
bait is not required, the mother-of-pearl
shank serving the same end. When wire
hooks are used, they wrap a piece of white
cloth round them.</p>

<p>The nets in which they take the flying fish
are made of twine of the same material.&mdash;They
are about a hundred yards in length, by
three or four yards in breadth, and have a
large bag in the centre.</p>

<p>They are set like herring-nets, with the
upper edge floated by buoys of light wood,
whilst the lower edge is kept under water by
weights of lead or iron. In order to prevent
the fish from flying over, branches of trees
are laid all along the head-line. When properly
extended, a canoe at each end of the
net, gradually advances, forming it into a circle,
into which the fish are driven by a number
of canoes, who fill up the open side, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
beat the surface violently with branches.&mdash;When
the canoes at each end of the net meet,
they gradually take it in, contracting the circle
till the fish are forced into the bag in the
centre.</p>

<p>In this manner prodigious numbers are taken.
I have known them return, after a day’s
fishing, with ten or twelve canoes deeply loaded.
Sometimes the net is so full they cannot
take it on board, and are obliged to drag it after
them to the shore.</p>

<p>They have a singular method of catching
fish by poison. This is done by means of an
herb like heath, stripped of its bark, and bruised;
with this they dive to the bottom, and
place it beneath the stones, where the fish lie.
The poison is so powerful, that in a short time
they sicken, and come up to the surface.&mdash;When
taken they are instantly gutted, in order
that the poison in their stomach may not affect
the quality of the fish.</p>

<p>The occupiers or proprietors of land are entitled
to the privilege of fishing upon their own
shores as far as the tallest man in the island can
wade at low water, and they may exercise
that right at all seasons; but beyond that the
sea is tabooed, except at two periods in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
year, of six weeks each, during which unlimited
fishing is allowed. At these times it is
the general employment of the natives, and
they cure enough to serve them through the
tabooed season.</p>

<p>In every article of their manufacture these
islanders display an extraordinary degree of
neatness and ingenuity, considering the simplicity
of the tools with which they work.</p>

<p>The tool in most general use is a kind of
tomahawk, or adze, called toe; it was formerly
made of hard polished stone, but is
now universally made of iron. To form it,
they lash a thin plate of iron, from one to four
inches broad, and five or six long, to a branch
which has a piece of the stem attached to it.
Plane irons are much in request for this
purpose; but the toe is frequently made of an
old hoop.</p>

<p>This, with a piece of coral for a file, is
almost the only tool used in the construction
of their houses, canoes, and implements of
wood.</p>

<p>The circular wooden dishes, containing
from half a pint to five or six gallons, are
formed with these simple tools, and are as
neatly made as if they had been turned in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
lathe. It is astonishing how soon they acquire
the useful arts from their visitors. Many of
the natives are employed as carpenters, coopers,
blacksmiths, and tailors, and do their work
as perfectly as Europeans.</p>

<p>In the king’s forge there were none but native
blacksmiths; they had been taught by the
armourer of a ship, who quitted the island
while I was there.</p>

<p>Almost all their dealings are conducted by
barter; they know the value of dollars, and
are willing to take them in exchange; but
they seldom appear again in circulation, being
always carefully hoarded up.</p>

<p>Vessels are supplied with fresh provisions,
live-stock, salt, and other articles of outfit, for
which they give in return cloth, fire-arms, and
ammunition, the teeth of the sea-lion, carpenter’s
tools, hardware, and, in general, European
articles of every description.</p>

<p>Sandal-wood, pearls, and mother-of-pearl
shells, are also the produce of these islands,
and are frequently purchased for the China
market.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Russians will, in future,
derive from hence the principal supplies
of provisions for their settlements on the Fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
islands, and northwest coast of America, and
even Kamschatka.</p>

<p>With the island of Atooi the natives carry
on a considerable trade. The inhabitants of
Wahoo excel in making taper or cloth, whilst
those of Atooi excel in canoes, paddles, and
spears, and they very often make exchanges
in these articles.</p>

<p>Owing to the number of ships that are constantly
touching at these islands, provisions
are by no means cheap. A pig is estimated
by its length. The largest size, called poanana,
or fathom pig, measures that length from
the snout to the rump, and is valued at two
axes; a junk of the thickest part of the sea-horse
tooth, five or six inches long, a yard and a half
of blue cloth, or five dollars.</p>

<p>Those that measure from the elbow to the
opposite hand, are valued at one axe, or about
half the price of the larger size. A sheep or
goat may be had for a smaller piece of ivory;
a maro, or a pair of fowls, for a knife, a pair
of scissors, or small mirror.</p>

<p>From their earliest years, the natives spend
much of their spare time in the water, and
constant practice renders them so dexterous,
that they seem as much at their ease in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
element as on land; they often swim several
miles off to ships, sometimes resting upon a
plank shaped like an anchor stock, and paddling
with their hands, but more frequently
without any assistance whatever.</p>

<p>Although sharks are numerous in these seas,
I never heard of any accident from them,
which I attribute to the dexterity with which
they avoid their attacks.</p>

<p>Throwing the top shoots of the sugar-cane
at each other, and catching them in their
flight, is a favorite amusement, the practice of
which tends to render them very expert in the
use of the spear.</p>

<p>Dancing, wrestling, and foot races, are also
common amusements, particularly at macaheite
time.</p>

<p>The dances are principally performed by
women, who form themselves into solid
squares, ten or twelve each way, and keep
time to the sound of the drum, accompanied
by a song, in which they all join. In dancing
they seldom move their feet, but throw themselves
into a variety of attitudes, sometimes
all squatting, and at other times springing up
at the same instant. A man in front with
strings of shells on his ankles and wrists, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
which he marks time, acts as fugel-man. On
these occasions the women display all their
finery, particularly in European clothes, if they
are so fortunate as to possess any. They received
great applause from the spectators, who
frequently burst into immoderate fits of laughter,
at particular parts of the song.</p>

<p>They have a game somewhat resembling
draughts, but more complicated. It is played
upon a board about twenty-two inches by
fourteen, painted black, with white spots, on
which the men are placed; these consist of
black and white pebbles, eighteen upon each
side, and the game is won by the capture of
the adversary’s pieces.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah excels at this game. I have
seen him sit for hours playing with his chiefs,
giving an occasional smile, but without uttering
a word. I could not play, but William
Moxely, who understood it well, told me that
he had seen none who could beat the king.</p>

<p>The game of draughts is now introduced,
and the natives play it uncommonly well.</p>

<p>Flying kites is another favorite amusement.
They make them of taper, of the usual shape,
but uncommon size, many of them being
fifteen or sixteen feet in length, and six or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
seven in breadth; they have often three or
four hundred fathom of line, and are so difficult
to hold, that they are obliged to tie them
to trees.</p>

<p>The only employment I ever saw Tamena,
the queen, engaged in, was making these
kites.</p>

<p>A theatre was erected under the direction
of James Beattie, the king’s block-maker,
who had been at one time on the stage in
England. The scenes representing a castle
and a forest were constructed of different
coloured pieces of taper, cut out and pasted
together.</p>

<p>I was present on one occasion, at the performance
of Oscar and Malvina. This piece
was originally a pantomime, but here it had
words written for it by Beattie. The part
of Malvina was performed by the wife of
Isaac Davis. As her knowledge of the English
language was very limited, extending
only to the words yes and no, her speeches
were confined to these monosyllables. She,
however, acted her part with great applause.
The Fingalian heroes were represented by
natives clothed in the Highland garb, also
made out of taper, and armed with muskets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The audience did not seem to understand
the play well, but were greatly delighted with
the after-piece, representing a naval engagement.
The ships were armed with bamboo
cannon, and each of them fired a broadside,
by means of a train of thread dipped in saltpetre,
which communicated with each gun,
after which one of the vessels blew up. Unfortunately,
the explosion set fire to the forest,
and had nearly consumed the theatre.</p>

<p>The ceremonies that took place upon the
death of a chief have been already described.
The bodies of the dead are always disposed
of secretly, and I never could learn where
they were interred. My patroness, the queen,
preserved the bones of her father, wrapt up
in a piece of cloth. When she slept in her
own house they were placed by her side; in
her absence they were placed on a feather
bed she had received from the captain of a
ship, and which was only used for this purpose.
When I asked her the reason of this
singular custom, she replied, “it was because
she loved her father so dearly.”</p>

<p>When the king goes to war, I understand
that every man capable of bearing arms must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
follow his chief; for which purpose they are
all trained from their youth to the use of arms.
I saw nothing like a regular armed force, except
a guard of about fifty men, who constantly
did duty at the king’s residence. There
were about twenty of them on guard daily,
but the only sentry which they posted was at
the powder magazine. At night he regularly
called out every hour, “All’s well.”</p>

<p>They were armed with muskets and bayonets,
but had no uniform; their cartridge-boxes,
which were made by the king’s workmen,
are of wood, about thirteen inches long,
rounded to the shape of the body, and covered
with hide.</p>

<p>I have seen those guards at their exercise;
rapidity, and not precision, seemed to be their
great object. The men stood at extended order,
and fired as fast as they could, beating
the butt upon the ground, and coming to the
recover without using the ramrod; each man
gave the word “fire,” before he drew the trigger.</p>

<p>The natives of these islands have been accused
of being cannibals; but as far as I
could judge, either from my own observation,
or from the enquiries I made, I believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the accusation to be perfectly destitute of foundation.
Isaac Davis, who had the best means
of knowing, having resided there more than
twenty years, and who had been present and
borne a share in all their wars, declared to me
most pointedly, that “it was all lies&mdash;that
there never had been cannibals there since
they were islands.”</p>

<p>From a perusal of the foregoing pages, it
will be seen, that these islanders have acquired
many of the useful arts, and are making rapid
progress towards civilization. Much must be
ascribed, no doubt, to their natural ingenuity
and unwearied industry; but great part of the
merit must also be ascribed to the unceasing
exertions of Tamaahmaah, whose enlarged
mind has enabled him to appreciate the advantages
resulting from an intercourse with
Europeans, and he has prosecuted that object
with the utmost eagerness.</p>

<p>The unfortunate death of captain Cook,
and the frequent murders committed by the
natives on navigators, particularly in Wahoo,
in which Lieutenant Hengist, and Mr. Gooch,
astronomer of the Dædalus, Messrs. Brown
and Gordon, masters of the ships Jackall and
Prince Le Boo, lost their lives, gave such ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the savage nature of the inhabitants, that
for many years few ships would venture to
touch at these islands.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>But since Tamaahmaah has established his
power, he has regulated his conduct by such
strict rules of justice, that strangers find themselves
as safe in his port as in those of any civilized
nation.</p>

<p>Although always anxious to induce white
people to remain, he gives no encouragement
to desertion, nor does he ever attempt to detain
those who wish to depart.</p>

<p>In 1809 the king seemed about fifty years
of age; he is a stout, well-made man, rather
darker in the complexion than the natives
usually are, and wants two of his front teeth.
The expression of his countenance is agreeable,
and he is mild and affable in his man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>ners,
and possesses great warmth of feeling;
for I have seen him shed tears upon the departure
of those to whom he was attached,
and has the art of attaching others to himself.
Although a conquerer, he is extremely
popular among his subjects; and not without
reason, for since he attained the supreme power,
they have enjoyed repose and prosperity.
He has amassed a considerable treasure in dollars,
and possesses a large stock of European
articles of every description, particularly arms
and ammunition; these he has acquired by
trading with the ships that call at the islands.
He understands perfectly well how to make a
bargain; but is unjustly accused of wishing
to over-reach in his dealings. I never knew
of his taking any undue advantages; on the
contrary, he is distinguished for upright and
honourable conduct in all his transactions.&mdash;War,
not commerce, seems to be his principal
motive in forming so extensive a navy. Being
at peace, his fleet was laid up in ordinary
during the whole time of my stay. When he
chooses to fit it out, he will find no difficulty
in manning his vessels. Independently of the
number of white people he has constantly
about him, and who are almost all sailors, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
will find, even among his own subjects, many
good seamen. He encourages them to make
voyages in the ships that are constantly touching
at the islands, and many of them have
been as far as China, the northwest coast of
America, and even the United States. In a
very short time they become useful hands, and
continue so as long as they remain in warm
climates; but they are not capable of standing
the effects of cold.</p>

<p>During my stay the building of the navy
was suspended, the king’s workmen being employed
in erecting a house, in the European
style, for his residence at Hanaroora. When
I came away, the walls were as high as the
top of the first story.</p>

<p>His family consisted of the two queens, who
are sisters, and a young girl, the daughter of a
chief, destined to the same rank. He had two
sons alive, one about fifteen, and the other
about ten years of age, and a daughter, born
when I was upon the island.</p>

<p>The queen was delivered about midnight,
and the event was instantly announced by a
salute of sixteen guns, being a round of the
battery in front of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>I was informed by Isaac Davis, that his eldest
son had been put to death by his orders in
consequence of criminal connexion with one
of his wives. This took place before he fixed
his residence at Wahoo.</p>

<p>His mode of life has already been described.
He sometimes dressed himself in the European
fashion, but more frequently laid aside his
clothes, and gave them to an attendant, contenting
himself with the maro. Another attendant
carried a fan, made of feathers, for the
purpose of brushing away the flies; whilst a
third carried his spit-box, which was set round
with human teeth, and had belonged, as I was
told, to several of his predecessors.</p>

<p>It is said that he was at one time strongly
addicted to the use of ardent spirits; but that,
finding the evil consequences of the practice,
he had resolution enough to abandon it. I
never saw him pass the bounds of the strictest
temperance.</p>

<p>His queen, Tamena, had not the same resolution;
and although, when he was present,
she durst not exceed, she generally availed herself
of his absence in the morai to indulge her
propensity for liquor, and seldom stopped short
of intoxication. Two Aleutian women had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
been left on the island, and were favorite companions
of hers. It was a common amusement
to make them drunk; but, by the end
of the entertainment, her majesty was generally
in the same situation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI. </h2>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>Departure from Wahoo&mdash;Pass Otaheite&mdash;Double Cape-Horn&mdash;Arrival
at Rio Janeiro&mdash;Transactions there, during
a residence of nearly two years&mdash;Voyage home&mdash;and
from thence to the United States.</p></div>


<p>The ship in which I left the Sandwich
islands was called the Duke of Portland,
commanded by captain Spence. She had
procured a cargo of about one hundred and
fifty tons of seal oil, and eleven thousand
skins, at the island of Guadaloupe, on the
coast of California, and had put into Wahoo
for the purpose of procuring refreshments.</p>

<p>Every thing being ready, we sailed from Hanaroora
on the 4th of March, and stood to the
southward with pleasant weather.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April we descried the
mountains of Otaheite, but did not touch at
that island.</p>

<p>About a week before we doubled Cape
Horn, we saw two large whales, and the boats
were hoisted out in the hope of taking them,
but it began to blow so hard that the attempt
proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in May we passed Cape Horn; the
captain stood as far south as the latitude of
60, and we never saw the land. Although
the season was far advanced we did not experience
the smallest difficulty in this part of
the voyage.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards we made the Falkland
islands; the land is of great height, and
seems perfectly barren.</p>

<p>Upon the 25th we saw the coast of Brazil,
and next day entered the harbour of Rio
Janeiro.</p>

<p>Being apprehensive of a mortification in
my legs, I applied for admission into the
English hospital, which is situated in a small
island that lies off the harbour. When captain
Spence, who took me thither in his boat,
mentioned that I had lost my feet in the service
of the Americans, he was informed, that
since that was the case, I must apply to them
to take care of me.</p>

<p>I then went on board an American brig,
called the Lion, the captain of which directed
me to call on Mr. Baulch, the consul for that
nation; by his interest I was admitted into the
Portuguese hospital, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de la miserecorde</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>During the whole voyage I experienced
the utmost attention and kindness from the
captain and crew of the Duke of Portland;
and when I quitted them they did not leave
me unprovided for in a strange country; they
raised a subscription, amounting to fifty dollars,
which was paid into the hands of the
Portuguese agent on my account.</p>

<p>I remained in the hospital ten weeks; the
Portuguese surgeons, although they could not
effect a cure, afforded me considerable relief,
and I was dismissed as well as I ever expected
to be.</p>

<p>I was now in a different situation from what
I had been either at Kodiak or the Sandwich
islands; I was in a civilized country, in
which I must earn my subsistence by my
own industry; but here, as well as there, I
was under the protection of Divine Providence,
and in all my misfortunes, I found friends who
were disposed to assist me.</p>

<p>Mr. Baulch, the American consul, gave me
a jar of the essence of spruce, which I brewed
into beer; and having hired a negro with a
canoe, I went about the ships, furnishing them
with that, and other small articles of refreshment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>While engaged in this employment, I went
on board the ship Otter, returning from the
South Seas, under the command of Mr. Jobelin,
whom I had seen in the same vessel at
the Sandwich islands. He informed me that
he had visited Wahoo a few months after my
departure, and found all my friends in good
health, except Isaac Davis, who had departed
this life after a short illness.</p>

<p>In this manner I was not only enabled to
support myself, but even to save a little money.
I afterwards hired a house at the rent of four
milreas a month, and set up a tavern and boarding
house for sailors; this undertaking not
proving successful, I gave it up for a butcher’s
stall, in which I was chiefly employed in supplying
the ships with fresh meat. This business
proved a very good one, and I was sanguine
in my hopes of being able to raise a small
sum; but an unfortunate circumstance took
place, which damped all my hopes, and reduced
me again to a state of poverty.</p>

<p>In the night of the 24th July, my home was
broken into, and I was robbed of every farthing
I had, as well as of all my clothes.</p>

<p>As the purchase of carcasses required some
capital, I was under the necessity of giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
up my stall for the present. I again took
myself to my old trade of keeping a bum-boat,
till I had saved as much as enabled me to set
up the stall again.</p>

<p>I was much assisted by the good offices of
a gentleman from Edinburgh, of the name of
Lawrie, who resided in my neighbourhood;
he took great interest in my welfare, and
was of essential service by recommending
me to ships, as well as by occasionally advancing
a little money to enable me to purchase
a carcase.</p>

<p>The state of my health, however, prevented
me from availing myself of the advantages of
my situation; the sores in my legs, although
relieved, had never healed, and gradually
became so painful as to affect my health, and
render me unable to attend to any business.</p>

<p>In consequence of this, I determined to return
home, in hopes of having the cure effectually
performed in my native country.</p>

<p>On the 5th of February, 1812, I quitted
Rio Janeiro, after a stay of twenty-two
months. I came home in the brig Hazard,
captain Anderson, and arrived in the Clyde
on the 21st of April, after an absence of nearly
six years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>After residing nearly four years in my native
country, and having still a desire to visit
the Sandwich islands, I left Scotland, in the
American ship Independence, commanded
by captain John Thomas, on the 3d of September,
1816, for New-York. We had sixty-three
passengers, and after a very tedious
voyage of fifty-three days, we arrived in good
health at our port of destination. I had
been led to believe that I should find no
difficulty in getting a passage to the Sandwich
islands from New-York; but after a
short residence there, I did not see any prospect
of obtaining a conveyance thither. My
funds growing low, I commenced soliciting
subscribers for my work. In this I met with
considerable success, and was enabled to
publish an edition of one thousand copies.
But on account of the ulcers in my legs never
healing, and being apprehensive of mortification,
I was deterred from proceeding any farther.
I therefore applied to the governors of the
New-York city hospital for admittance, with
the intention of having my legs amputated
higher up, so that I might not be troubled
with them in future. I was accordingly admitted
on the 4th of November, 1817; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
on the 20th of the same month, one of my
legs was taken off a little below the knee.
The second operation was performed on the
17th of January following; and I was enabled
to leave the hospital on the 3d of April,
1818.</p>

<p>I still wished to return to the Sandwich
islands, and having so far recovered as to
be able to walk about with considerable ease,
and the favourable appearance of my wounds
indicating a thorough cure, I therefore made
application to several gentlemen in New-York,
by whose means my intentions were
represented to the Prudential Committee of
the American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Missions. By their advice I removed
to the institution belonging to that body, at
Cornwall, Litchfield county, Connecticut, in
order that I might there study under the Rev.
Herman Daggett, and that I might become
acquainted with several young men, in that
place from the Sandwich islands; to the end,
that if ever it should please Divine Providence
to permit me to visit those islands again, I
might be able to render them and the cause of
religion, all the assistance that lay in my
power, and that my influence might be ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>erted
on the side of virtue; and, above all
things, that I might be instrumental in forwarding
the introduction of missionaries into
those dark and benighted islands of the sea.</p>

<p class="break p4 center large">APPENDIX No. I.<br />

A VOCABULARY<br />

<span class="small">OF THE</span><br />

<span class="smaller">LANGUAGE OF THE SANDWICH ISLANDS.</span></p>


<p>In pronouncing the words as spelt in the vocabulary,
<em>all letters must be sounded</em>, with the exceptions after
mentioned.</p>

<p>In sounding the vowels, A has always the sound of the
initial and final letter in the word <i>Arabia</i>.</p>

<p>E, as in the word <i>eloquence</i>, or the final Y in <i>plenty</i>.</p>

<p>The double E, as in <i>keep</i>.</p>

<p>I, as in the word <i>indolence</i>.</p>

<p>O, as in the word <i>form</i>.</p>

<p>The double O, as in <i>boot</i>, <i>good</i>.</p>

<p>U, as in the word <i>but</i>.</p>

<p>The diphthongs Ai, as the vowel sounds in <i>tye</i>, <i>fly</i>, or
the I in <i>diameter</i>.</p>

<p>Ei, as in the word <i>height</i>.</p>

<p>Oi, as in the word <i>oil</i>.</p>

<p>Ow, as in the word <i>cow</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>All other combinations of vowels are to be sounded
separately; thus, <i>oe</i>, <i>you</i>, and <i>roa</i>, <i>distant</i>, are dissyllables.</p>

<p>In sounding the consonants, H is always aspirated; the
letters K and T, L and R, B and P, are frequently substituted
for each other.</p>

<p>Thus, <i>kanaka</i>, <i>tanata</i>, people; <i>ooroo</i>, <i>ooloo</i>, bread-fruit;
<i>boa</i>, <i>poa</i>, a hog.</p>

<p>Where the words are separated by a comma, they are
synonymous, and either may be used; but where there is
no comma, both must be used.</p>

<p>Example. <i>Taate</i>, <i>Keike tanne</i>, a boy.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that the same word is repeated
twice, in which case it is connected with a hyphen; thus
<i>leepe-leepe</i>, an axe.</p>

<p class="p4 break center">
<span class="large">STATEMENT</span><br />

OF THE<br />

<span class="larger">CASE OF ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL.</span></p>


<p>The bearer hereof, named Archibald Macbrait, has had
the misfortune to have both of his feet frostbitten in so
dreadful a manner, that nothing remained but to endeavour
to save his life, as there were no hopes whatever of preserving
his feet, although every attempt was made to that effect.</p>

<p>For the information of the humane and benevolent, I
subjoin a short statement of my proceedings in his case,
fearless of any compunctions of conscience; being sensible
of the hard fate of this poor fellow creature, and how much
he stands in need of assistance to support his existence.</p>

<p>This Englishman sailed from Kodiak in the winter time,
in the ship’s cutter, for the island of Sannack. On their
passage a storm came on, in which the boat was wrecked.
The crew saved their lives on shore; but this man had both
his feet frozen, and not having stripped off his clothes for
twenty-seven days, he was not aware of the extent of his
calamity, and did not apprehend the destruction of his feet.</p>

<p>The overseer of the district of Karlutzki brought him to
Kodiak, at eight o’clock in the evening, to the hospital called
the Chief District College of Counsellor and Chevalier
Baranoff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, I had his feet cleaned and dried; they
were both in a state of mortification (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gangrena sicca</i>.)
The mortified parts having separated from the sound to
the distance of a finger’s breadth, where either amputation
might take place or a cure be performed, as the patient
himself hoped. I dressed the mortified, or frostbitten parts
with oil of turpentine, and the unaffected parts with olive
oil, and continued these applications for about five days,
after which I used charcoal, gas, and other chimical applications;
but as there appeared no chance of saving his
feet, I began to consider that there was no resourse left but
amputation. That the patient might not be alarmed, I
talked over the matter with him as is usual in such cases,
and endeavoured to persuade him to submit to the operation,
as the only means of effecting a cure. But at first I
was not successful, and could not get him to agree to it.
I was therefore obliged to continue my former mode of
treatment. At the end of three days, however, he gave his
consent, and I fixed a time for the operations, which I
performed satisfactorily. On the third day after the operation,
the wound appeared to be in a good state, and I continued
to dress it daily as it required.</p>

<p>The other foot remained to undergo a similar operation.
I suffered three weeks to elapse, when it also took place.
The wounds are now in a good state, and evidently healing
up.</p>

<p>It is not in my power to complete the cure, being obliged
to return to Russia; but I have left the directions with the
assistant surgeon how to proceed in the treatment.</p>

<p>The illness of Archibald Macbrait, this Englishman,
commenced on the 22d of January, 1808. The first opera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>tion
took place on the 15th of March, and the second on
the 15th of April. He is twenty years of age, and well
made. He was cured by Dr. Nordgoorst, actually in the
service of the Russian American Company.</p>

<p>This statement should support the petition of this Englishman,
who may seek an asylum in Greenwich hospital,
where the unfortunate of this kind obtain relief and comfort.</p>

<p>N. B. This is an accurate description of the case and
treatment; but the true christian name and surname of the
patient, is Archibald Campbell.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<span class="small">AUTHOR OF THE VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.</span></h2>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>




<p class="break p4 center">
<span class="smaller">NOTICE OF</span><br />

ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL.</p>

<p class="center">[From Blackwood’s Magazine.]</p>

<p>Our readers cannot have forgotten the name of Archibald
Campbell, the poor Scottish seaman, whose account of
his voyage round the world was, three or four years ago,
noticed at considerable length in the Quarterly Review.
This unhappy adventurer’s narrative was, in every way,
well deserving of the interest which it created at the time
of its publication. It was modest and unassuming in its
manner, and, in its matter, free to a great extent, from the
many species of blunders and inaccuracies which are commonly
so abundant in the productions of persons in the
humble situation of life of Archibald Campbell. At that
time, however, its merits could not be quite so fully appreciated
as now. Although the apparent candour of the
mariner was well qualified to lend credit to all his statements,
yet even his benevolent editor abstained from expressing
himself in any very decided manner respecting
their authority, and the same diffidence was, of course,
shared by his reviewer. But in the years which have now
intervened, the narratives of succeeding voyages have given
perfect confirmation to all the assertions of Campbell; and
his story may, therefore, be considered as forming an au<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>thentic
link in the history of the Sandwich Islands, with
regard to which, for several years previous to his arrival
there, we had received no certain or direct intelligence.</p>

<p>We refer to Campbell’s book itself, and the review of it
already mentioned, for any information which our readers
may require in order to restore them to a perfect acquaintance
with the early and important incidents in his various
life. At the time when his book was published, it will be
recollected, the sores upon his legs were still in a very distressing
condition, owing to the unskilful manner in which
they had been amputated below the ankle, by the Russian
Surgeon, into whose hands he fell immediately after they
were frostbitten. The period of tranquil existence which he
had spent in the Sandwich islands, the voyage homewards,
and a residence of many months in his native country, had
all been found insufficient to remove the irritation of his
wounds; and he was still not only a cripple, but an acute
sufferer, when he attracted the attention of Mr. Smith, in
the Clyde steam-boat. The kindness of that excellent
person soon enabled him to lay the story of his afflictions
before the public, and the success of the book was such,
as to furnish a sum far beyond the expectations of Archibald
Campbell. Had he remained in this country during
the time when the public impression was strongly in his
favour, there is reason to believe that something might
probably have been done to provide the means of comfortable
retirement to one whose errors, in themselves venial,
had been so severely punished in the person of the offender,
and had furnished a lesson so capable of doing good to
others. Neither Campbell nor his friends, however, entertained,
at the moment, any expectations of such a nature,
and the poor man, whose patience was quite ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>hausted,
resolved, as soon as he got a little money into his
hands, to seek in it the means of being once more transported
to the friendly territories of king Tamaahmaah, and his
own comfortable farm on the banks of the Wymumme. In
the midst of all his distresses, he found leisure for courtship,
so he set sail with his wife, in the autumn of 1816, for
New-York, in the hope of finding a passage to Owhyhee, on
board of some of the American ships, which have, of late
years, been almost the only visitors of these islands. On
the 23d of December following, he writes as follows, to a
medical gentleman in Glasgow, who had shown him much
kindness while in that city:&mdash;“I am very sorry to inform
you that we shall have no opportunity of going to the Sandwich
Islands this season, the vessels having all left Boston
for the northwest coast before our arrival, and it is very
likely that there will be no more ships going that way until
they return again, which will not be these two years; therefore
I am at a loss what to do. There is nothing at all doing
here in my line, and times are much worse here than at
home, and a great many of the passengers that came out
with us have gone home again, not being able to find work
of any kind.” He then states his intention to procure, if
possible, a passage to the Brazils, where he had before been.
In the meantime, however, it was announced that some person
was about to publish an American edition of his book,
which unhandsome procedure Archibald forthwith took the
most effectual method of preventing, by publishing an American
edition of it himself. Of this edition he sold 700 copies
in a month, and cleared about 300 dollars on the speculation.</p>

<p>His legs continued all this time to be as troublesome as
ever; and Campbell determined to give himself a chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of being a sound cripple, by having them amputated over
again above the ankle. This resolution he carried into
effect last winter with the most perfect fortitude. His right
leg was amputated on the 20th of November, 1817, and
the bursting of an artery a few hours after the operation,
threw him into a brain fever, from which he escaped with
difficulty. “My whole leg,” says he, “began from the
end of the stump to be inflamed with erysipalas, combined
with phlegmatic inflammation, which, luckily for me, turned
into a suppuration. I am happy to inform you, that ever
since, I have been mending so fast, that I was able to go
home all last week, and it is only yesterday, (January 13,
1818) that I returned to have the other leg cut; and the
surgeon says I shall have a better chance of recovery, as
my habit is not so full.” The second operation was accordingly
performed in a few days after this, and his recovery
was even more easy than he had been led to expect. “As
soon as I got out of the hospital,” says he, “I made myself
a pair of artificial legs, with which I already begin to walk
pretty tolerably, and am going to Albany, Baltimore, &amp;c. to
get subscriptions for the second edition of my book.”</p>

<p>But during his stay in New-York, Campbell has not
been an author, publisher, and patient only. He has also
been carrying on various little species of traffic, in globe
glass mirrors, plaster of Paris casts, Scots Almanacks, &amp;c.
&amp;c. with various, but, on the whole, not very flattering
success. As soon as he shall have sufficiently supplied the
transatlantic reading public with his voyage round the
world, Archy, who is a Jack of many trades, purposes to
turn another of his talents to a little advantage, and to
make a voyage to the Clyde “to see his friends,” in the
capacity of a cook to a merchantman. He still, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
has a hankering after his “steading” in Owhyhee; and it
is probable that ere long we shall have it in our power to
inform our readers that he has come to “his ain again.”</p>

<p>We might quote some farther passages from his letters to
his friend in Glasgow; but although they are all highly interesting
to those who have seen any thing of the man, we
are apprehensive of trespassing too far on the patience of
the general reader. The letters are written in a clear, distinct
style, and in a very good penmanship; and his account
of the state of things in America, so far as it goes, shows
that Archibald has been in his youth no inattentive or unworthy
member of some of the “literary and commercial”
clubs, so common in the west of Scotland. The letters are
all concluded in a very polite manner, as thus:&mdash;“Be pleased,
Sir, to give our best respects to your father and sisters,
and our compliments to your servant maids; meantime, we
remain, Sir, your most obedient and very humble servants,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Archb. &amp; Isabella Campbell.</span>”
</p>

<p>We trust our readers will pardon us for detaining them
so long with the history of this poor countryman of ours.&mdash;Those
of them who have read his book will, we are quite
sure, be happy in this renewal of their acquaintance with
him; for our own parts, we hope he will, on his arrival,
forthwith publish a full account of his adventures during
this last voyage. He must now be pretty well initiated into
the ways of the booksellers, and we do not see why Mr.
Campbell should not succeed as well in his transactions
with that slippery generation, as many other authors of
greater pretension.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX, No. IV. <br />


<span class="smaller">HISTORICAL ACCOUNT</span><br />

<span class="small">OF THE</span><br />

SANDWICH ISLANDS.</h2>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>




<p class="break p4 center">
HISTORICAL ACCOUNT <br />

<span class="small">OF THE</span><br />

<span class="large">SANDWICH ISLANDS.</span></p>


<p>When captain Cook discovered the Sandwich islands,
in 1778, Tereoboo was king of Owhyhee; Titeree, of
Moratai; and Pereoranne, of Wahoo, and the islands to
leeward. The sovereignty of Mowee was contested by
Tereoboo and Titeree; the former claimed it for his son,
who had married the daughter of the deceased king; the
latter claimed it as heir male to the former sovereign. In
consequence of this dispute, these chiefs were engaged in
war at the above mentioned period; but captain King
understood, before he quitted the islands, that an arrangement
had taken place, by which Titeree retained Ranai
Taharoora, whilst Mowee was ceded to Tewarro, the son
of Tereoboo. Tamaahmaah, the present king, is known
in Cook’s Voyage by the name of Maiha-Maiha, and was
present at the death of that illustrious navigator. He was
the eldest son of Kaihooa, only brother to Tereoboo, and
after his son, Tewarro, next heir to the succession.</p>

<p>After the departure of the Resolution and Discovery,
no ships touched at the Sandwich islands till the year 1787.
During the interval that had elapsed, considerable revolutions
had taken place. Tereoboo was dead, and his do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>minions
shared between his sons, Tewarro and Tamaahmaah;
and Titeree had conquered the islands of Mowee
and Wahoo.</p>

<p>The accounts of these transactions, owing to the few opportunities
of inquiry which the navigators who touched at
these islands enjoyed, and their ignorance of the language,
are extremely contradictory.</p>

<p>By one account, Tereoboo is said to have been put to
death by Tamaahmaah; by another, that he fell in battle;
and by a third, that he died a natural death. The causes
of the division of his territory between his son and nephew
are involved in equal obscurity.</p>

<p>The ship Iphigenia, commanded by captain Douglas,
arrived at Owhyhee in 1788, being the first which touched
at that island after the death of captain Cook. There was
on board of her a chief of Atooi, named Tianna, who had
the preceding year accompanied captain Meares to Canton,
and had been enriched by the kindness of his English
friends, with a valuable assortment of European articles,
arms, and ammunition.</p>

<p>Tianna was a man of great activity and ambition, and a
distinguished warrior. These qualities, and his wealth,
particularly in fire-arms, rendered him an acquisition of
much consequence to an enterprising chief like Tamaahmaah;
and he induced him to settle upon Owhyhee, by
conferring upon him high rank and extensive tracts of land.</p>

<p>Captain Douglas had with him a small tender, built upon
the northwest coast of America. When Tamaahmaah
learned this, the idea of having a similar one built, immediately
occurred to him; and he pressed that gentleman
with so much urgency to allow him the assistance of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
carpenter, that he was obliged to give a conditional promise.
Although the promise was never fulfilled, Tamaahmaah
did not abandon the project; and soon afterwards he prevailed
upon an Englishman of the name of Boyd, who had
been bred a ship-carpenter, to undertake the construction
of a vessel.</p>

<p>About the same time, two other Englishmen, named
Young and Davis, of whom some account is given in the
work, became resident upon Owhyhee, and with their
assistance he determined to build a vessel. Fortunately
for the attainment of this object, captain Vancouver arrived,
and with the aid of his carpenters, he was enabled
to accomplish his favourite object, by the completion of his
first decked vessel, the Britannia.</p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned, to his honour, that whilst thus
anxious to lay the foundation of a navy, he had in his possession
a small schooner, which had been seized by a chief
called Tamahmotoo, and which he had carefully preserved,
in the hopes of restoring it to her owners.</p>

<p>In 1791 he attacked Titeree, and captured the islands of
Mowee, Morotai, and Ranai. Whilst engaged in this expedition,
he received information that his own dominions
were attacked by Tewarro,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and he was, in consequence,
obliged to abandon his conquest and return.</p>

<p>By the energy of his operations he soon vanquished his
opponent, who was slain by Tianna, and the whole island
of Owhyhee was reduced under his dominion. In the
mean time, Titeree, availing himself of his absence, recovered
the islands he had lost.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>Affairs were in this situation when Vancouver arrived,
in March, 1792. He found the islands in a most wretched
state, from the long wars that had taken place; and he
endeavoured, but without effect, to establish a peace between
Titeree and Tamaahmaah.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah was so sensible of the advantages which
would result from a closer connexion with a civilized power,
that he made a formal surrender of the sovereignty of the
island to the king of Great Britain, with the reservation,
that there should be no interference in their religion, internal
government, or domestic economy.</p>

<p>Soon after the departure of captain Vancouver, Titeree
died, leaving the island of Wahoo to his son Tritoboorie,
and Mowee to his son Korkoranee.</p>

<p>A dispute arose between Tritoboorie and his uncle Tahaio,
king of Atooi, who laid claim to Wahoo; but Tritoboorie,
supported by Mr. Brown, and the crew of the ship
Butterworth, not only repelled Tahaio, but even invaded
Atooi.</p>

<p>Tamaahmaah, availing himself of these dissensions, invaded
and conquered Mowee, Morotai, and Ranai. Next
year, 1795, he invaded Wahoo with one detatchment of
his force, leaving Tianna to follow him with the other.
Whilst waiting the arrival of that chief, he received the
unexpected intelligence that he had gone over to the enemy;
while, at the same time, an insurrection had broke out
in Owhyhee, headed by Nomataha, brother to Tianna.
Instead of being overwhelmed by this unexpected intelligence,
he took the resolution of instantly attacking his
enemies. The war was decided by a sanguinary battle,
fought near the village of Whyteete, in which Tamaahmaah
was completely victorious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Young and Davis accompanied him upon this expedition,
and were of essential service to him from their knowledge
of fire-arms.</p>

<p>Tianna lost his life in the battle, while the sons of Titeree
found refuge in Atooi. Tamaahmaah immediately
returned to Owhyhee, and soon quelled the insurrection in
that island.</p>

<p>He remained there about a twelvemonth; but either with
a view of consolidating the conquests he had already made,
or of extending them farther, he proceeded to Laheina, in
Mowee, where he resided a few years, and afterwards removed
to Wahoo, where he was during the whole time of
our author’s stay, in 1809 and 1810.</p>

<p>Of the history of Atooi and Onehow, the only islands in
the groupe independent of Tamaahmaah, little is known
with certainty. Captain King says, that in 1779, they
were governed by the grandsons of Perioranne, king of
Wahoo. It is probable, that upon the conquest of that
island by Titeree, they were also conquered; for it appears
that Tahaio, or Taio, brother of that chief, was king of
these islands when captain Vancouver visited them in
1798. He was succeeded by his son Tamoree, or Comaree,
who was king of these islands in 1810.</p>

<p class="break p4 center">NOTES. </p>


<h3><i><a id="NOTE_A"></a>NOTE A.</i></h3>

<p>The author kept a journal in the early part of the voyage;
but it was lost in the events which succeeded, and he
was afterwards placed in circumstances where it was not
in his power to keep one. He has in his possession, however,
several documents which serve to ascertain many of
the dates. These are,</p>

<p>1st. His letters to his mother, written whenever an opportunity
presented itself, and which she preserved.</p>

<p>2d. A certificate from the East-India Company of the
time when he quitted their service.</p>

<p>3d. The statement of his case by the Russian surgeon, a
translation of which will be found in the Appendix No. <a href="#Page_189">II.</a></p>

<p>The other dates are given from memory, and are either
such as a sailor would naturally remember, or circumstances
of so remarkable a nature that they could not fail of fixing
themselves in a memory much less retentive than that of
our author.</p>

<p>Whenever the editor has had it in his power to verify
them by collateral authorities, he has not failed to do so;
and the result of the inquiry has been, even where corrections
were necessary, to show the general accuracy of the
narrative: For example, his written account of the first
part of the voyage is literally, “The convoy sailed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the Motherbank on 12th May, 1806, and cleared the Channel
on the 18th; was twelve weeks on our passage to the
Cape of Good Hope; lay at the Cape fourteen or fifteen
days; sailed from the Cape about the 19th August, and
on the 19th September made the island of St. Paul’s;
arrived at Pulo Penang about the middle of October, and
sailed on the 24th November; left Admiral Trowbridge’s
flag-ship, the Blenheim; arrived at China the eighteenth
January, 1807.”</p>

<p>He added, that the convoy left the Cape upon a Friday,
and on the three following Saturdays they had each day a
gale of wind; that on the third of these Saturdays they
passed St. Paul’s.</p>

<p>Some difficulties arose, however; for, upon consulting
the Almanack, the editor found that the 19th August, 1806,
was not a Friday, but a Tuesday. Upon asking the reason
of his fixing on these particular dates, he showed a
letter to his mother, dated Portsmouth, 11th May, saying,
the fleet was to sail next day; from whence he concluded
the convoy sailed on the 12th; and counting twelve weeks,
would fix their arrival at the Cape on Monday, the 4th of
August; and fifteen days would make Tuesday, the 19th,
as the day they left.</p>

<p>Upon consulting the newspapers of the time, it appears
that the fleet did not sail till the 14th of May, and arrived
at the Cape on the 7th of August, being just twelve weeks
and one day; and fifteen days more fixes the day of sailing
on Friday, the 22d. The editor has not discovered
whether the other dates in this part of the voyage are correct
to a day; but the author says, that the loading of the
ships was stopped about six weeks after their arrival, in
consequence of the dispute with the Chinese. Counting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
six weeks after the 18th of January, would fix it about
the 1st of March. By the accounts from Canton, in Note
B, it appears that this actually took place upon the 4th;
which renders it probable that the date is correct, or at
least pretty nearly so.</p>

<p>In addition to these original documents, the editor has in
his possession a number of accounts, in the author’s hand,
of particular parts of the voyage, and the printed account
of his adventures, <i>in metre</i>, referred to in the preface.</p>

<p>Immediately after his return, in 1812, a gentleman in
Paisley undertook to get an account of his adventures published,
provided he drew it up himself. He accordingly
made some preparations; but the death of the gentleman
prevented the publication.</p>

<p>The Vocabulary was written by the author as he recollected
the words, and transmitted to the editor, who arranged
them, and afterwards read them over to him, correcting
the spelling from his pronunciation, according to the rules
which are prefixed to it.</p>

<p class="center">DISPUTE WITH THE CHINESE AT CANTON,
<span class="smcap lowercase">IN</span> 1807.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extract from the Morning Chronicle, 26th August, 1807.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Canton, March 4.</i>&mdash;The English Company are involved
in considerable trouble, in consequence of some
one of the crew of their ship Neptune having killed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Chinese, for whose life this government have required one
of the crew to be delivered up, which had been positively
refused. This refusal has produced the stoppage of all the
chops for that ship; and Mouqua, (second of the Hong,)
by whom she is secured, has been with the linguist for the
ship, carried in chains inside of the city. I have conversed
with Cheongqua and Conseequa, who have assured me no
inconvenience will attend the Americans; but they assert
positively a man must be given up.</p>

<p>“The sailors have behaved most infamously: They
hauled down and danced on the Spanish flag, and then
destroyed it. Their captain apologized, and next day
compelled them to hoist a new one. Some few of the
scoundrels showed a disposition to pull down the American
colours; and a part of them were in the act of lowering
the Swedish, but were prevented. They have burnt one
of the mandarin’s houses in front of the factories. This
shameful conduct has induced the Chinese to determine,
that no more sailors shall be permitted to come up on
liberty. It is generally thought the English business,
except the country, will all be stopped in a day or two.
The English including the Lion man of war, at Bocca
Tigris, amount to 1600 men. A few days will decide the
unfortunate business.”</p>

<p>“<i>March 6.</i>&mdash;We are every hour afraid of a rupture
between the English and Chinese, in consequence of the
death of a Chinese, from the accidental stroke of a club by
an English sailor.</p>

<p>“The Chinese demanded an Englishman to die, conformable
to the laws of their country; and the English
have refused, being unable to find out the person who
gave the blow. In consequence, the viceroy of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
province gave orders yesterday to stop their trade; and in
all probability the next step will be to intercept their supplies,
and seize on some person of the factory; a circumstance
which must produce the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>“I understand the English have no objection to give up
a man, provided they could find out the guilty person; and
surely they cannot be blamed for spurning the idea of
making an innocent man suffer. God only knows how it
will end. They are allowed three days more to decide;
and if they do not comply, it is thought the Chinese will
endeavour to compel them. Should they be foolish
enough to attempt the latter plan, I think they will get a
sound drubbing, as the English have now a force at
Wampooa and Bocca Tigris of 2000 able-bodied men, all
eager for attack.”</p>


<p class="center">MORNING CHRONICLE, DECEMBER 4.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Extract of a letter from a gentleman lately resident in China, dated
Canton, April 18.</i></p>

<div class="nobreak blockquot">

<p>“The affair between the English Company and the Chinese is
at length adjusted. After many meetings, chin chinnings, &amp;c. &amp;c.
the Chinese government ordered up for trial the fifty-two sailors belonging
to the Neptune, that were on liberty when the fray happened.
This order was complied with on the part of the Company;
and about the 25th of March the sailors arrived in Canton, under
the protection of a company of marines from the Lion ship of war.
After they had reached Canton, the mandarins intimated that they
must be taken into the city for examination. This was resolutely
opposed; and it was finally agreed, that the trial should be held in
the Company’s old factory, the lower part of which was accordingly
fitted up in great style, with yellow and crimson silk carpets, cushions,
tables, chairs, &amp;c. &amp;c. the whole intended to represent the
emperor’s court. The business now appeared favourable, but was
soon shaded by another serious occurrence. The mandarin who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was to sit in awful judgment, required that the chief of the Company,
the captain of the Lion, and the commodore of the Company’s
ships, should not be permitted to sit in his presence during the trial.
This was not acceded to, and threats were uttered on the part of the
British. The mandarin was equally obstinate, and the business assumed
a very serious aspect. As the mandarin could not come
himself, or send one of high order, he sent one who was willing that
the British should sit at their ease in good elbow chairs. Thus
arranged, about the 6th instant the trial commenced; and of fifty-two
sailors, eleven were selected as the most guilty, and laid over
for farther proof. On the 9th, the eleven were again brought
up for trial, and two were selected as the guilty persons, who
were again laid over for farther investigation. On the 11th,
the two were again brought forward, and one of them adjudged
guilty, and ordered to be kept in possession of the Company, till
the pleasure of the emperor should be known. The British ships
are now loading, and will sail in about a fortnight. What fate
awaits the sailor retained is uncertain; but it is probable that the
mandarins would rather touch a few of the security merchants’
dollars, and keep the affair from the emperor, than retaliate the
outrage against their countrymen. In this case, not less than one
hundred thousand dollars will be necessary to patch up the affair.”</p></div>

<p>In the appendix to Sir George Staunton’s account of the
Penal Code of China, there is a detailed statement of the
proceedings of the Chinese court in this case. The editor
has had no opportunity of seeing the work; but the following
abstract, taken from the Quarterly Review, Vol. III.
p. 315, will show how the cause terminated.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The British factory was fitted up as a court of justice; the great
officers of state, and the judges attended; and the result was, the
singling out of eleven men, as having been the most active in the
affray. On a re-examination of these men, they endeavoured to
prevail on some one to plead guilty, under an implied promise that
he should not be punished. This failing, it was suggested that the
affair might be got over, if the officers of the Neptune would depose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
that they had seen a sailor carrying a bamboo stick over his
shoulder, against which, in the hurry and confusion, a Chinese had
accidentally run his head. The proposal of so ridiculous and pitiful
expedient met with the contempt it deserved. The next suggestion
was, that some one of the sailors should be prevailed on to state,
that finding an attempt made on his pocket, he had struck behind
him, and might thus have wounded the deceased. This expedient
meeting with no better success, they proceeded in their examination,
and dismissed all except two, Julius Cæsar, and Edward Sheen. It
appeared that Julius Cæsar had a small cane in his hand on the day
of the riot, but was not outside of the factory; and that Edward
Sheen was outside of the factory, but did not carry a stick; he confessed,
however, that he had a Chinese tobacco pipe in his hand, the
tube of which was of bamboo, the court, therefore, decided that he
carried a stick, and, consequently, that he was the culprit. Having
got thus far over the ground, a long negotiation took place as to the
disposal of Edward Sheen, until the final decision of the case should
be received from Pekin; and it was at length agreed that he should
be left behind in charge of the supercargoes.</p>

<p>“Having thus briefly stated the leading facts, we shall now see in
what manner the case was represented to the supreme court at Pekin,
and its decision thereupon. It is contained at full length in No. II.
of the appendix, p. 521.</p>

<p>“The viceroy of Canton states, for the information of the supreme
court, that Edward Sheen, an Englishman, being in the upper story
of a warehouse which overlooked the street, and in which there was
a window opening with wooden shutters, did, on the 18th day of the
first moon, employ a wooden stick, in an oblique direction, to keep
open the shutter; and that, in doing this, the wooden stick slipped
and fell downwards; that Leao-a-teng, a Chinese, passing at the
moment, was struck and wounded by the falling of the said stick upon
his left temple, and that on the evening of the following day he died
in consequence of the wound. That repeated orders had been given
to the chief of the English factory to deliver up the man to justice;
that, in reply, it was alleged the said criminal was sick of an ague
and fever, and under medical treatment; that on his recovery, he
was confronted with the relations of the deceased; that after repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
examinations, the said criminal, Edward Sheen, had acknowledged
the truth of all the facts here stated, without reservation;
that he had, consequently, been proved guilty of accidental
homicide, and ought, therefore, to be sentenced to pay the usual
fine, to redeem himself from the punishment of death by strangulation.</p>

<p>“Upon this report the supreme court observes, that the case
appears to be one of those acts, of the consequences of which,
neither sight, hearing, or reflection, could have given a previous
warning; that the said Edward Sheen should, therefore, be allowed
to redeem himself from the punishment of death by strangulation,
by the payment of a fine (amounting to about 4<i>l.</i> 3s. sterling) to the
relations of the deceased, to defray the expenses of the burial, and
then be dismissed to be governed in an orderly manner in his own
country.”</p></div>

<p>It appears that the bribe necessary to procure acquiescence
of the parties interested, to this mockery of justice,
did not cost the security merchants less than £50,000.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Captain Broughton mentions a harbour which he surveyed, called
Fair Haven, which lies five or six miles E. S. E. of Whyteete; it is
formed by an opening through the reefs, with a clear channel, in a
N. N. E. direction. The wind generally blows fresh out of it, rendering
it necessary to warp in, as there is no room for working. The
harbour, though of small extent, is safe and convenient, with five
fathoms sandy bottom within the spits. A fine stream of fresh water
empties itself at the head. It was discovered in 1794 by Mr. Brown,
master of the Butterworth, the same who was afterwards murdered
by the natives at this place. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> <cite>Broughton’s Voyage</cite>, p. 39.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This inlet is evidently the same which Captain Vancouver surveyed,
and which, he says, is named Oropoa; finding that, in consequence
of the bar, it was only navigable for small craft, the survey
was not continued. He merely says, that within “it seemed to
spread out, and to terminate in two bays about a mile farther to the
northward.” He mentions another opening to the eastward, called
by the natives Honoonoona, which must be either Bass’s harbour or
Hanaroora. From the similarity of the name, it is more probably
the latter place; but he passed it without examination, being informed
that it was shallower than the other inlet.</p></div>

probably runs little risk in thus exposing himself. Vancouver relates,
that in a sham-fight he saw him ward off six spears that were
hurled at him almost at the same instant. “Three he caught as
they were flying with one hand; two he broke by parrying them
with his spear; and the sixth, by a trifling inclination of his body,
passed harmless”&mdash;<cite>Vancouver</cite>, Vol. III. p. 254.</p></div>

instead of the Sandwich islanders, or if our author has not fallen

Campbell, upon being questioned, related several instances of its
having occurred in Wahoo. He cannot say as to the practice of

of the king’s name adopted by Vancouver and Broughton.
Although, to his ear, it would be more correctly Tameamea. Every
voyager has spelt it in a different manner. Captain King has spelt
it Maiha Maiha; Mr. Samwell, the surgeon of the Discovery, who
published an account of Captain Cook’s death, Cameamea; Portlocke,
Comaamaa; Meares, Tomyhomyhaw; Vancouver and
Broughton, Tamaahmaah; Lisianski, Hameamea; Langsdorf, Tomooma;
and Turnbull, Tamahama. As the hard sound of <i>C</i> and
<i>T</i> is scarcely to be distinguished in the pronunciation of the language,
and the h is silent, the reader, from a comparison, will be
able to ascertain the most correct way.</p></div>
